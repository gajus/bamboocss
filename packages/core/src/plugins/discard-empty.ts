/**
 * `postcss-discard-empty`'s predicate, field for field.
 *
 * Two of these clauses are load-bearing here in ways that are easy to lose when reimplementing:
 *
 * - A custom property is kept even with an empty value. `--a: ;` is a valid declaration that
 *   registers the property, and dropping it changes what `var(--a)` resolves to.
 * - A *named* empty `@layer` is kept, because `@layer utilities{}` is what declares the layer
 *   and fixes its position in the cascade order. An anonymous empty one (`@layer{}`) has no
 *   name to declare and still goes, which is the difference between the third clause's
 *   exemption and the fourth clause's reach. Bamboo's `@layer reset, base, …;` statement has
 *   params and no body, so no clause touches it.

/**
 * What `postcss-discard-empty` produces, without its per-removal sibling scan.
 *
 * Upstream removes each empty node through `Node.remove()`, and postcss resolves that with
 * `Container.removeChild`, which calls `indexOf` over the parent's children and then splices.
 * That is linear per removal, so a pass costs removals x siblings. Hand-written CSS never
 * notices; a generated stylesheet does, because every condition's block sits under one cascade
 * layer as a sibling of every other, and `mergeRules` runs immediately before this and leaves
 * the shells behind. Specifically it leaves empty *at-rules*, not empty rules: every path that
 * empties a rule also removes it, and the one that does not is `mergeParents`, which lifts a
 * rule out of its enclosing at-rule and never revisits the parent. A 663 kB sheet measured
 * here arrives with 6,005 empty `@media` shells and zero empty rules. The sibling count and
 * the removal count therefore both grow with the config, and their product is what this costs.
 *
 * Measured over a sibling group half of which is empty, against a parse-only control. All
 * three variants run interleaved in one process, best of seven, because the machine this was
 * taken on could not be quieted and alternating them is what keeps the comparison honest:
 *
 *     siblings   control   upstream     this    upstream/control   this/control
 *        8,000     8.5ms     26.8ms   18.8ms                3.2x           2.2x
 *       16,000    11.8ms     54.0ms   29.0ms                4.6x           2.5x
 *       32,000    25.7ms    369.0ms   53.9ms               14.4x           2.1x
 *
 * The last two columns are the point rather than the speedup: this stays a fixed multiple of
 * the control across the range, the way a linear pass does, and upstream does not.
 *
 * Rebuilding each container's `nodes` array once is the whole difference -- same predicate,
 * same depth-first order, so the same nodes are dropped and the output is byte-identical.
 * `discard-empty.test.ts` pins that against upstream on the shapes the predicate distinguishes.
 *
 * One deliberate divergence: upstream pushes a `removal` message onto `result.messages` per
 * node. Nothing reads them here -- `ctx.messages` is bamboo's own catalogue, unrelated -- and
 * on the sheet above that is 6,005 objects allocated to be thrown away.
