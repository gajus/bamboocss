 * bind and check the entire program, `.d.ts` files included. That cost is paid by every
 * project on every build, scales with the size of the codebase rather than with the number
 * of style calls, and does not show up in a benchmark small enough to have no program to
 * check. See `resolve-imported-value.ts`, which crosses the import boundary directly for the
 * few expressions that need it.
