/**
 * The values an expression borrows from other modules, resolved by reading the imports.
 *
 * A call to a helper in a neighbouring file has to resolve, or its declarations are silently
 * absent from the stylesheet — and for a recipe that is not a partial loss but a different
 * hash and an element with no styles at all.
 *
 * The evaluator can be handed a TypeScript type checker to follow the import itself, and was
 * for a while. That is far more than the job needs: asking for one symbol makes TypeScript
 * bind and check the whole program, every reachable `.d.ts` included. Measured on a 400-file
 * project it cost **+38% CPU and +30% peak RSS**, and because the expense is the checker
 * existing rather than how often it is consulted, it grows with the size of the codebase
 * rather than with the number of style calls — a large project reported a 5.4x extraction
 * slowdown and an OOM in CI.
 *
 * Following an import is two cheap steps: ask the caller's source-graph resolver to place the
 * specifier, then read that file's exported declaration. Crossing the import boundary is the
 * only thing the checker was doing here.
 *
 * The evaluator resolves everything *within* a module by walking scopes, so a helper that
 * refers to another binding in its own file needs nothing from us.
