   * consumer's `css()` beats it by cascade rather than by stylesheet order.
   *
   * It used to call `__atomicCss(resolve(props))`: resolve the whole style object, then
   * name a class per property. Reaching for the shared `css` instead would have returned a
   * grouped class no rule was emitted for, which is why the atomic seam existed at all.
   * Semantic naming removes the question.
