/**
 * An arity check for the `light-dark()` calls a stylesheet actually contains.
 *
 * `light-dark()` takes exactly two arguments and CSS cannot group a comma-separated value
 * into one of them, so a fold whose arm is a list emits three or more and the browser drops
 * the declaration outright. That failure is invisible from inside a test suite: the sheet
 * still contains the token, the class naming it still looks correct, and nothing errors.
 *
 * What let it through was the assertion these suites reach for — `toContain('light-dark(')`
 * is satisfied by `light-dark(a, b, c)` just as well as by a valid call. So the check runs on
 * every sheet a suite generates rather than on the one a given test happens to inspect;
 * arity is decidable without a CSS parser, which makes that essentially free.
 *
 * Deliberately a second implementation rather than an import of the generator's own scanner.
 * A guard sharing code with the thing it guards agrees with it about a bug, and this one has
 * to read the emitted text the way a browser parses it.
