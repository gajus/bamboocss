/**
 * `cx` joins class names. It does not resolve conflicts between them, in any build.
 *
 * It used to, when the class names happened to carry a property to compare — atomic mode
 * with `hash.className` off. That made it a correctness tool in development and a plain
 * join in a hashed production build, from the same source, with no error either way. An
 * override that worked locally silently stopped working when it shipped.
 *
 * The two could not be reconciled by teaching the matcher to read hashed names: under
 * `hash: true` a class is an opaque digest with no property to compare.
 *
 * So precedence is decided where it can be decided the same way everywhere: by
 * {@link https://bamboocss.com/docs/concepts/cascade-layers cascade layers}. A component
 * whose styles a consumer will override belongs in `recipes` — write it with `cva`/`sva`,
 * not bare `css()` — and the consumer's `css()` in `utilities` wins by layer, in every
 * build. Two `css()` outputs joined with `cx` are in the same layer and resolve by source
 * order; when you own both, merge the style objects with `css(a, b)` instead.

    *
    * To override a style rather than append to it, let the cascade decide: styles from
