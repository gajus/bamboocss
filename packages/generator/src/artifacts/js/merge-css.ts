/**
 * `mergeCss` and friends, plus the shorthand table they need.
 *
 * Split out of `css.mjs` because `cva` needs the merge and nothing else. Keeping it separate
 * prevents recipe-only imports from reaching the class-naming engine.
 *
 * The shorthand table lives here rather than beside the class names, and that is the second
 * half of the same problem. `cva` reaches `mergeCss` through `raw()` and `merge()` — both
 * properties on the object `cva()` returns, so neither can be shaken away — and while the
 * two tables were one, that dragged the *naming* table into every bundle using recipes.
 * Measured on `sandbox/vite-ts`: 2,786 B gzipped of a 6,769 B `cva`-only bundle, 41% of it,
 * for a map the recipe path never reads.
 *
 * Separating them costs about 402 B gzipped in a bundle that still calls `css()` at runtime,
 * because the two halves share every property name and each now spells the list. That is the
 * trade, and it is the right way round: the Vite compiler removes authored runtime calls.
 *
 * Nothing here reaches the `styled-system/css` barrel. `css.raw(...)` is the authoring API
 * for merging style objects, and it is `mergeCss` plus the defensive clone that makes a
 * shared, memoized result safe to hand to a caller — so exporting the uncloned function
 * beside it offered a footgun under a second name. `cva` imports it from here directly.
