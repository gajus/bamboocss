   * is never re-entered: an accumulating record either keeps a finding past the edit that
   * fixed it — wedging a dev server — or is cleared and then never refilled, which passes a
   * build whose source is still broken. That second one is the worse failure and is what an
   * earlier version of this did.
   *
   * `decoder.atomic` has neither problem, because it is not a record of what happened — it is
   * what the sheet is built from, and each result keeps the `prop` and `value` it was written
   * with. So the question asked is the one that matters: does the stylesheet *being emitted*
   * contain a declaration the browser will drop.
   *
   * Within a watch process that set is cumulative, and so is the css: extraction is additive,
   * so the rule for a style deleted from source is still in the sheet until the process
   * restarts. This reports the same way for the same reason — the declaration really is still
   * in the file being written, and saying otherwise would be a check that disagreed with its
   * own output. A production build is a fresh process and sees only what its source asked
   * for.
   *
   * **Config-derived styles are not in that set at all**, which is the gap this used to have.
   * `globalCss`, the reset, config recipes and compositions serialize through
   * `transformStyles`, and that clones the decoder — so their atoms land in a throwaway and
   * `decoder.atomic` never hears about them. Reading only the sheet made `'error'` *quieter*
   * than the default on exactly those styles: the warning was suppressed in favour of a check
   * that could not see them, so a bad token in `globalCss` warned with the option unset and
   * then passed silently with it set to `'error'`. `utility.unresolvedTokens` is the record of
   * what only `transform` can see; see it for why accumulating is right for that half.
   *
   * Both halves key on `property:path` with shorthands resolved, so a value that does reach
   * both — every atomic style is transformed once before it is memoized — is one finding.
   *
   * Here rather than beside the asserts in `BambooContext` because this is where the sheet
