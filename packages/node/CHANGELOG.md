## 1.50.0

### Minor Changes

- f0a9265: Sort the source glob, so extraction order does not depend on the filesystem.

  `fast-glob` returns `readdir` order, which is not the same on every machine. That order is not cosmetic: it is the
  order atoms enter the stylesheet, and stylesheet order is what settles a conflict between two classes that land on one
  element — `cx` concatenates them and the browser picks by position, not by the order they were passed.

  Unsorted, two checkouts of the same commit could build sheets that disagree about whether `px_4` or `px_2` wins, with
  nothing raised to say so. It also left the emitted bytes irreproducible, which is what content-hashed asset names are
  derived from.

  Sorted by code unit rather than `localeCompare`, whose answer depends on the host's locale — the same class of
  machine-dependence.

  A project whose filesystem already returned an ordered glob sees no change. One whose did not may see rules move
  within the sheet; the set of rules and the class names are unaffected.

- c1870de: Extract through the TypeScript 7 backend, and stop shipping ts-morph.

  Every AST call site in the extractor, parser, node runtime and Vite plugin now reads through `@bamboocss/ts-ast`.
  `ts-morph` is no longer a dependency of any of them, so it is no longer installed into a consumer's tree — it survives
  only as a dev dependency of the two benchmarks that compare the backends.

  Emitted CSS is unchanged. The codegen scenarios regenerate to a byte-identical tree — 248 files, same hash — which is
  the property that mattered most: this is a change of how bamboo reads source, not of what it decides.

  The swap is mostly mechanical, and the parts that are not are where ts-morph's API meant something the compiler's does
  not. Each of these was a silent wrong answer rather than a crash:
  - **`getLiteralText()` returned the cooked value, not the source span.** Read as source, a quoted key keeps its quotes
    and `` `1px ${token(…)}` `` reaches the stylesheet with its backticks intact.
  - **`getNameNode()` on an import specifier is the _imported_ name**, where TypeScript puts that under `propertyName`
    and the local binding under `name`. Reading `name` resolves an aliased import against its alias, finds no such
    export, and drops the styles it named.
  - **`getProperty()` covered type literals too**, whose members live under `members` rather than `properties`. Without
    it a `declare const tokens: { readonly shadows: … }` resolves to nothing, and a lookup miss poisons the whole
    literal — every property after the first quoted key disappeared with it.
  - **`isNamespaceExport()` meant both `export *` and `export * as ns`.** Seeing only the first lets a module that
    re-exports the runtime be compiled away.
  - **`parseDiagnostics` was a property on the source file.** TypeScript 7's nodes are views over a buffer another
    process owns and carry no such property, so the guard the token accounting uses to decline a file it cannot parse
    read as "parsed cleanly" — and pruned tokens that were live.
  - **A hole in an array binding pattern** was its own node in TypeScript 6 and is a nameless `BindingElement` now, so
    `([, value]) => …` stopped evaluating and a `clsx`-style helper silently contributed no classes.

  Two things the compiler does not do at all, and now bamboo does:
  - **Module resolution reads through the project.** A file the bundler handed over as text exists only in the overlay,
    and a resolver that reads past it to the disk cannot place a relative import at all.
  - **`.vue`, `.svelte` and `.astro` are parsed under an alias.** TypeScript 7 decides script kind from the extension
    and refuses what it does not recognise, whatever text is supplied — so a single-file component, whose script block a
    `parser:before` hook has already turned into TSX, is held under a name the compiler accepts and reported under its
    own.

### Patch Changes

- 0f13170: Stop rewriting generated artifacts whose contents have not changed.

  Codegen wrote every file in the output directory on every build, whether or not a byte had moved. The write itself is
  cheap — 54 artifacts and 1.4 MB measure ~6ms, against ~1.3ms to read them back and compare — but the mtime is not.
  Everything downstream watches that directory: the dev server's module graph, `tsc --incremental`, any bundler with it
  in scope. Each of them was re-doing work for files identical to the ones it had already read, on every build.

  Most builds move nothing. `csstype.d.ts` alone is 895 kB copied verbatim from a constant.

  An unchanged rebuild now touches **0 of 54** artifacts rather than all of them. Adding one colour token rewrites
  exactly the four files that contain it — `styles.css`, `tokens/index.mjs`, `tokens/tokens.d.ts` and
  `types/prop-type.d.ts` — and leaves the other fifty alone.

  `package.json` keeps its own path: it is merged with what the consumer already declared rather than overwritten, so
  its generated contents never equal the file on disk.

## 1.49.0

### Minor Changes

- 0030767: Stop loading, on every command, the modules only one command uses.

  A full build spent about half its time importing modules, before reading a single source file. Three of those imports
  were reachable from an entry that bundles, so they were parsed by every invocation — including the ones a build makes
  from a Vite `buildStart`. Deferring them takes a cold build from ~480ms to ~395ms, and `bin/cli-default` from 339 kB
  to 26 kB.
  - `update-notifier` is dynamic now, and only runs where a TTY could show the notice. It costs nothing to _run_ — the
    registry check is a detached child — but it carries semver, configstore and boxen, and a build has no reader: the
    CLI runs with `stdio: 'ignore'`, or in CI where the box lands in a log nobody opens.
  - `@clack/prompts` loads inside `init -i`, the one path that prompts.
  - `@bamboocss/reporter` loads inside `analyze`. It is one command, but the module sits behind `@bamboocss/node`'s
    index, so the CLI on any command and the Vite plugin on every build were loading the report formatters to run
    neither.

  **`analyze()` is now async.** Deferring the import is what makes it so; `await` it. This is a breaking change to
  `@bamboocss/node`'s API, released as a minor deliberately — it is one function, on the CLI's `analyze` command and the
  MCP server's analysis tool, both updated here.

  What remains is the wall: TypeScript and ts-morph are ~104ms of the ~215ms still spent importing, and extraction needs
  them. Trimming around that is close to done.

## 1.48.0

### Minor Changes

- b961974: The Vite compiler and the stylesheet now compile against one context.

  A project used to resolve its config twice per run: the CSS plugin through its `Builder`, the compiler through a
  `loadConfigAndCreateContext` of its own. That meant two `BambooContext` objects and two complete ts-morph projects
  over the same files, neither able to see what the other established — and a config edit reloaded only one of them,
  which is why it had to restart the dev server rather than rebuild.
  - `bamboocss()` creates one internal compilation host holding one lazy `Builder`. Both plugins take their context from
    it, `Builder.setup` runs once for the compiler's `enforce: 'pre'` `buildStart` and the CSS plugin's that follows,
    and the compiler re-derives its runtime `css` and style-set compiler whenever the Builder replaces its context.
  - The compiler parses through a clone of the context's encoder, so folding a module adds no rule to the stylesheet.
    `Project.parseJson` now restores a dumped encoder into the encoder it was given rather than always into the
    context's.
  - A transform's text is parsed under the file's own path only when ts-morph already holds exactly those bytes.
    Otherwise it goes to a sibling path, so a `pre` plugin's rewrite cannot become the source the next extraction pass
    reads. Those sibling parses resolve normally but are excluded from the ledger, the dependent walk and the
    unresolved-importer set.
  - `Builder.reloadSource` and `Builder.removeSource` are how an integration sharing the context refreshes an edited
    source. They snapshot the resolution ledger before mutating, which is the graph the next pass needs to find the
    file's dependents.

  One project instead of two: website builds measured 1.77–2.02 GB peak RSS against 2.11 GB before.

- 49839f1: Remove obsolete PostCSS injection APIs and generated runtime modules. Compiled stylesheet assembly now emits
  recipe declarations directly as shared utility atoms instead of creating named recipe layers and deleting them
  afterward.
- 235397c: Remove the incompatible cascade-layer `polyfill` configuration and CLI flags from the Vite-only styling
  integration.

## 1.47.0

### Minor Changes

- 74f06ce: `bamboo cssgen` (and the CLI `bamboo` command) emit the same compiled stylesheet Vite serves.

  Observed recipes are interned as shared utility atoms and the recipe layer is omitted, so a `cva()` or config-recipe
  selection has the same class names in a cssgen sheet as in a Vite build. The previous split is why a consumer had to
  avoid `cva` when the sheet came from cssgen.

  `cssgen --splitting` still writes per-layer files; it no longer writes per-recipe files, because those rules are not
  in the compiled sheet. A later compiled run deletes `styles/recipes/` and `styles/recipes.css` left by an earlier one.

- df4a653: Require Vite as the styling integration. Vue, Svelte and Astro compile after the framework plugin; the
  PostCSS package and CLI export are removed.

## 1.46.2

### Patch Changes

- 4700d64: Cut the dev server's per-edit stylesheet and update costs further, with byte-identical output.
  - The stylesheet's source-derived scans — token references, the strict accounting, keyframe references, rendered
    elements — now run as one walk instead of up to three, and each file's contribution is cached against the same mtime
    evidence the extract skip already trusts, so a rebuild re-scans only what changed. A cache-on/off harness pins byte
    equality across edits, and unchanged rebuilds are asserted to read zero source files.
  - The virtual stylesheet's build yields to the event loop between extraction and emission, so module responses are no
    longer serialized behind the whole pass.
  - The edited file's fold is pre-warmed right after the watch event, off the awaited path, so the browser's refetch
    hits a memoized fold instead of paying it on the repaint path.
  - Dependent verification before an update is announced now runs only for client graphs. Server graphs invalidate their
    fold dependents outright: nothing is announced either way, the next render re-transforms lazily off the repaint
    path, and the verification was costing every edit ~15ms of pre-broadcast latency on a react-router app.
  - Watch-file registration for the stylesheet reuses the session's extracted-file set instead of re-globbing the
    include patterns on every load.

  - Content edits now invalidate the extractor's memoized cross-file values by path instead of clearing every cache:
    each entry already records the module paths its computation read — the same record the watch system replays into
    fold dependencies — so a generation stamp turns that read-set into a lazy validity check. File-tree changes keep the
    full clear, since a created or deleted file can move what a specifier resolves to without any recorded path
    changing. A warm-vs-cold equality harness pins parity across value edits, barrel re-routes, tree changes, and the
    bundler's same-path content flips; the biggest effect is on the transform path, where alternating module shapes
    previously wiped every cache on each call.

  - Dependent verification now answers from recorded reads before re-folding. Every fold records the cross-file values
    and recipe configs it consumed together with a digest of what it read; when a shared module is edited, each
    dependent is verified by re-digesting the edited file's read values — one parse for all dependents — instead of
    being re-folded from scratch. A value that keeps its bytes while moving files still updates the dependency edges, a
    removed export reads as changed, and any unverifiable read falls back to the full re-fold. On the arena app this
    takes the pre-broadcast hook cost of a shared-module edit from ~25-35ms to ~2-3ms.

  - The stylesheet builder applies the same read verification to extraction: a dependent whose bytes did not move is
    re-extracted only if a value it read from an edited file re-digests differently or the edited file's recipe surface
    (declared cva/sva configs plus export statements) moved. Resolution-configuration changes, JSX component tracking,
    and anything unverifiable disable the skip. The byte-equality harness pins every edit class — unread values, read
    values, recipe configs, export aliases — against a cold build.

  Measured on the six-page react-router arena app (edit-to-repaint, pooled across reversed-order passes): component-file
  edits ~184ms → ~112ms; shared-module edits improve with the same changes but remain gated by dependent verification
  and sheet emission. `toCss` alone drops from ~17ms to ~8ms on that app, and the scan cache turns the per-rebuild scan
  cost from O(project) to O(changed files) — the larger the project, the larger the win.

## 1.46.1

### Patch Changes

- ef618b8: Cut dev-server HMR latency roughly in half by eliminating repeated work per edit.

  One source edit used to pay for the same work several times over: every Vite environment (client and SSR) regenerated
  and re-optimized the complete stylesheet on its own load of `virtual:bamboo.css`; the same file content was parsed and
  folded up to four times (once per environment, plus each update a framework re-drives); `hotUpdate` re-verified every
  dependent per environment; and `Builder.setup` re-bundled and re-evaluated `bamboo.config.ts` on every rebuild even
  though a config edit restarts the dev server anyway.
  - The virtual stylesheet is now built once per change: a watcher-driven generation counter lets concurrent environment
    loads join one pass and serves later loads of the same generation from the validated result.
  - Fold results are memoized per file content within one change event and shared across environments, hooks, and
    framework-re-driven updates, including the provisional re-folds `hotUpdate` uses to decide what to invalidate. The
    resolution-closure walk is memoized the same way.
  - `Builder.setup` skips the config reload in dev when nothing in the config graph (config file, its bundled imports,
    explicit `dependencies`, tsconfig chain) changed on disk, and `Builder.extract` reuses the file inventory the same
    pass already globbed.

  Measured on a six-page react-router app (edit-to-repaint, Playwright): a shared style-module edit went from ~230 ms to
  ~140 ms and a component-file edit from ~250 ms to ~135 ms medians, with per-edit server CPU dropping from ~130–160 ms
  to ~45–60 ms. Emitted CSS is byte-identical; build-mode behavior is unchanged.

## 1.46.0

### Patch Changes

- 37ca1e8: Defer a context's initial parser source loading and AST creation until its Project first performs a
  source-graph operation. Source-read, ts-morph Project construction, and AST construction errors now surface on that
  first source operation rather than during context construction. Standalone parser Projects stay eager with their
  native mutable raw-project property; the context-only deferred wrapper exposes its raw ts-morph Project through a
  materializing non-configurable accessor whose setter remains the supported replacement boundary. During its atomic
  preload, every public wrapper entry rejects reentrant access before exposing live state or invoking callbacks.

  Route every Bamboo cross-file value, helper, re-export, and imported-recipe lookup through a Project-owned resolution
  ledger. Local sources outside `include` are loaded on demand, external packages remain outside the source graph, and
  every semantically traversed local source runs `parser:before` once per source revision before extraction or ledger
  publication, so consumer-first and dependency-first parsing agree. Reverse dependencies reflect that exact effective
  AST. Missing local `paths`, `baseUrl`, package-import, and package-self targets remain pending across add/remove
  cycles, and successful local fallbacks retain missing higher-priority candidates so an add event redirects their
  importers, while external packages stay outside the graph. The parser exposes internal, read-only resolution facts and
  resolved-source paths for transactional Node consumers; extractor callers that need cross-file traversal can supply
  the same resolver through `BoxContext`.

  Keep incremental extraction and CSS output aligned with that ledger. Builder, CLI watch, and Vite now invalidate the
  complete semantic dependent closure—including excluded local helpers and resolution-config changes—without treating
  runtime-only imports as style dependencies. Recreated files and higher-priority alias targets are detected, removed
  files regenerate CLI output, client/SSR query variants retain their own cached dependency facts, and file-owner order
  is reconciled against the current inventory so incremental CSS remains byte-identical to a clean build.

## 1.45.2

### Patch Changes

- 00e7af9: Drop a file's old rules when it is read again, instead of keeping every version it ever had.

  `StyleEncoder` only ever added. It is built once with the context, a context outlives rebuilds, and nothing on it
  could remove a hash — so a long-lived process accumulated: each save of an edited file put its new atoms in and left
  the previous version's behind, for the life of the dev server. The orphans were valid CSS and internally consistent,
  which is why nothing caught them; one session ended with 22 classes no element could ever carry.

  Every parse is now attributed to an owner, and reading the same file again replaces what its last reading encoded
  rather than adding to it. Ownership is refcounted per hash, so a declaration two files share survives one of them
  dropping it; asking the question any other way would mean scanning the project on every keystroke, which is the cost
  the mechanism exists to avoid. The retain of the new reading runs before the release of the old one, so a declaration
  a file keeps across its own edit goes 1 -> 2 -> 1 and never passes through the zero that would delete it. All five
  collections are covered — atomic styles, recipe variants, recipe bases, compound variants and view transitions — as
  are the utility atoms a static build interns for a recipe, which an inline `cva` renames on every edit of its styles.

  Two things are deliberately never released. Anything encoded outside a file — a `staticCss` safelist, a restored
  encoder dump — answers to config rather than to source, so no file may take it away. And the extraction pass and a
  bundler transform hold their readings of the same module separately, because the two can legitimately see different
  source and neither should be able to narrow the other.

  Deletion is covered only where the encoder that emits the stylesheet is the one told about the delete.
  `Project.removeSourceFile` now releases the file, which reaches `bamboo --watch` and the PostCSS-driven watch — both
  call it on the context they go on to build from. The Vite dev server does not: its two plugins hold a `BambooContext`
  each, and `watchChange` releases on the compiler's while the stylesheet comes from the CSS plugin's. A file deleted
  under `vite dev` keeps its rules until the process restarts, exactly as before. That split predates this change and is
  left alone here.

  `bamboo --watch` is improved rather than finished, for a related reason. Its first pass reads every file through
  `parseFiles` and each rebuild re-reads only the changed ones through `parseSourceFile` — different entry points, so
  different owners, and the first reading is never replaced. A watch session is therefore bounded at two readings of a
  file rather than one per keystroke, which is not yet "the last reading replaces the one before it".

  Build output is unchanged. Every file is read once in a build, so nothing is ever released and no ordering or content
  can move: verified byte-identical across the emitted stylesheets of every sandbox, through the CLI and through a Vite
  production build, with the generator artifacts regenerating identically.

  Per-edit cost is unmeasured. The machine available ran at load 12–16 throughout, where run-to-run spread on the
  extraction benchmarks exceeds any effect this could have — a reading taken there would be noise reported as a result.
  A benchmark for the path this adds is included (`extract-modes`, `css() calls, re-read into the same encoder`), so the
  measurement can be taken on a quiet machine.

### Patch Changes

- 2d97c50: Stop token accounting from materializing the token tree to find identifiers.

  `SyntaxKind.Identifier` is 80 and sorts below `SyntaxKind.FirstNode` (167), the boundary between tokens and parse-tree
  nodes. ts-morph therefore cannot search the parse tree for it and falls back to building the whole **token** tree —
  and `usedAsValue` asked once per name, so a file was re-scanned in full for every binding the pass enquired about.

  Replaced with a raw `ts.forEachChild` walk that tests the name on the compiler node and builds a ts-morph wrapper only
  for the survivors, which is the expensive half. Measured at 18.8x on the pattern actually changed (177ms to 9.4ms
  across 400 real source files, same 565 nodes found), and 27.7x for the identifier scan alone.

  Behaviour is unchanged, including the part that is easy to get wrong: `ts.forEachChild` does not descend into JSDoc
  while `getDescendantsOfKind` does, and 72 of the 1,116 source files here carry an identifier visible only that way.
  Dropping those would not have declined or accounted anything — the reference would simply not exist, and the artifact
  would prune as though the file never mentioned the token. The JSDoc descent is restored explicitly and pinned by two
  tests that fail without it.

## 1.44.0

### Minor Changes

- 78b4de5: `prune.tokens` takes a boolean again, and token accounting is the default.

  It was `'off' | 'reachable' | 'accounted'`, which conflated two separate questions: how hard to try to bound the keep
  set, and what to say when that fails. `'reachable'` answered one cheap question — _does any javascript reach for a
  token_ — and threw away everything else it had read, so a single `token()` call anywhere kept all 468 declarations of
  the default preset. `'accounted'` did the work properly but was framed as an assertion, so it reported by default and
  had to be asked for. The combination nobody could ask for was the useful one: do the work, and stay quiet.
  - `prune.tokens: boolean`, default `true`. `false` is the old `'off'`; `true` accounts for each token path
    individually, which is what `'accounted'` did.
  - `prune.unresolvedPath` now defaults to `'off'` rather than `'warn'`. Pruning is an inference the build makes
    unasked, not a claim you told it to check, so it is silent unless you ask. `'warn'` names what is holding the keep
    set open; `'error'` still asserts the fallback never ships.
  - A config still passing a string fails with the edit to make. `'off'` is the dangerous direction — it asked for no
    pruning and would otherwise have silently got the opposite.

  Two things to check when upgrading:
  - **A token read from outside `include` is no longer covered by accident.** The old default kept every declaration the
    moment any javascript reached for a token, so a project with one `token()` call in it protected its scripts, configs
    and sibling workspace packages without meaning to — and a project with none did not. The accounting sees only what
    `include` covers, so name those categories with `prune: { keepTokens: ['colors.*'] }`. This is the trade the change
    makes deliberately: consistent pruning with a declared bound, rather than protection by coincidence.
  - **`prune: { unresolvedPath: 'error' }` written without `tokens` now fails builds it used to ignore.** It was inert
    unless you also asked for `'accounted'`; it is read directly now, which is what the setting always claimed to mean.

  A file that can neither name the artifact nor decline on its own is now skipped before the identifier walk, so the
  accounting costs nothing where there is nothing to account for. It has to be wider than the word `token`: a configured
  `importMap.tokens` need not contain it, an identifier may be written with unicode escapes, and `require()`/`import()`
  decline on a specifier the build cannot read whatever it names. `sandbox/vite-ts` has six files under `include` and
  not one of them mentions a token: `cssgen` there measures 22.0 ms under the old default, 31.5 ms under ungated
  accounting, and 22.9 ms now.

  Measured across the 16 sandboxes: 15 emit a byte-identical stylesheet, none keeps more than it did, and none reports
  anything. `preact-ts` goes from 448 token declarations to 37, and 20,627 B to 6,395 B. This repository's documentation
  site goes from 500 declarations to 146, 86,644 B to 73,773 B raw and 12,829 B to 10,903 B brotli, and its `cssgen`
  from 65.0 ms to 79.1 ms.

### Patch Changes

- f7a6d4c: Token accounting no longer declines on a local binding named `token`.

  The accounting walk keyed on the spelling of an identifier, so `items.map((token) => token.value)` — token _objects_,
  and the obvious name for them — declined once per read as an `unresolved-reference`. One decline anywhere keeps every
  token declaration in the project, so a single such component was the difference between the accounting pruning and the
  accounting emitting the same stylesheet as no pruning at all.

  A binding this file declares itself is now resolved and skipped: parameters (destructuring included), catch variables,
  function and class declarations, named function and class expressions, and a variable destructured off one of those —
  `const { token } = props`. A type or class member named `token` is likewise a declaration name rather than a
  reference, and no longer reaches the resolver that could not read it.

  What still declines is unchanged, and deliberately so: `const token = …` in general, since its initializer can be
  anything, including the artifact reached through a barrel or a `require`; a destructure off a namespace or imported
  object, for the same reason; and a property _name_ on an object this pass never bound, since `theme.token(k)` can
  reach the artifact whatever else the file declares.

  On this repository's own documentation site this was 40 declines across seven components, none of them a token call.
  The token layer goes from 500 declarations to the 146 that are referenced, and the stylesheet from 86,644 B to 73,773
  B raw — 12,829 B to 10,903 B brotli, −15.0%.

  Measured while the accounting was still opt-in, a cold `cssgen` over that site was unchanged at 65.0 ms before and
  66.0 ms after. The same release makes the accounting the default and reports that cost separately.

## 1.42.0

### Minor Changes

- 4fcae37: A `zIndex` scale in the preset, and `hash: 'auto'`.

  **`zIndex` tokens.** There was no such category, so every project invented one — usually as raw numbers scattered
  across components, occasionally as semantic names copied from another design system. The second is the one that bites:
  `zIndex: 'overlay'` against a theme declaring nothing resolves to nothing and ships `z-index: overlay`, which parses,
  so no build objects, and which the browser discards — leaving the element with no stacking context at all. This repo's
  own documentation site shipped that, in a drawer copied from Chakra.

  `hide` `base` `docked` `dropdown` `sticky` `banner` `overlay` `modal` `popover` `skipNav` `toast` `tooltip`, spaced so
  a project can slot its own layer between two without renumbering. Additive: twelve custom properties, no existing rule
  changed.

  **`hash: 'auto'`** hashes class names in production and leaves them readable in development. The mode comes from the
  integration — the Vite plugin's dev server is development, everything else is production — and is resolved once at
  context creation, so the emitted CSS and the compiled class literals cannot disagree about a name.

  Measured on a five-page react-router app, `hash: { className: 'auto' }` against the default:

  |                    | readable  | hashed            |
  | ------------------ | --------- | ----------------- |
  | stylesheet, raw    | 37,527 B  | 32,429 B (−14%)   |
  | stylesheet, gzip   | 7,610 B   | 7,894 B (**+4%**) |
  | longest class name | 105 chars | 6 chars           |

  **The gzip column is why this is not the default.** Readable names repeat, so they compress almost to nothing; hashes
  are incompressible. The raw sheet shrinks and the compressed sheet grows. Where hashing does pay is the _markup_ — a
  105-character class serialising a whole `linear-gradient()` appears in every document that uses it, and each document
  is compressed on its own — which is where the 20%-of-class-attribute-bytes figure that prompted this came from.
  Whether that trade is worth it depends on how many documents a project ships and how many arbitrary values it writes,
  so it is a decision to make with your own numbers rather than one to inherit.

## 1.40.1

### Patch Changes

- 8985e58: Generate `styled-system/` from the build, so a clone does not need the CLI first.

  `Builder.emit` is what puts the generated system on disk for an integration, and on the first call it wrote nothing:

  ```ts
  if (this.hasEmitted && this.affecteds?.hasConfigChanged) { … }
  this.hasEmitted = true
  ```

  The flag it reads is set by the same method, one line down, so the first call could only fall through — artifacts
  appeared on a _later_ call that also carried a config change. The Vite plugin's call site has always been commented "a
  fresh clone has to get those files from the first `vite dev`", and it did not: with no `styled-system/` on disk,
  `vite dev` served an error overlay and `vite build` failed with
  `Rolldown failed to resolve import "styled-system/css"`. Nothing caught it because every project runs `bamboo codegen`
  from a `prepare` script, so the directory was always already there.

  Reaching `emit` through `load` would not have been enough either. A module's imports are all resolved before any of
  them is loaded, so a `root.tsx` importing both `styled-system/css` and `virtual:bamboo.css` has the first resolved
  while the directory is still absent. The Vite plugin therefore generates in `buildStart` — the first hook Rollup calls
  — and the first `load` is handed that pass rather than repeating it. The dev watcher drops it when an extracted file
  changes, so a first load that arrives after an edit still regenerates.

  What this buys is a build step deleted rather than made faster. A project that runs `bamboo codegen && vite build` can
  drop the first half: on one react-router app that step is 585 ms, of which ~20 ms is generating the files and the rest
  is a second Node process loading `ts-morph` and the extractor to do it. `prepare` scripts stay useful — `tsc` and the
  editor want the types before anything builds — and nothing about their output changes: the same 55 artifacts,
  byte-identical CSS.

  Later emits stay narrow, which is what the original guard was reaching for: a watch rebuild re-emits only the
  artifacts a config change affected, and one that changed no config writes nothing.

### Minor Changes

- 3151b14: Make `bamboo init` write the answers it collects, and stop steering Vite projects onto the runtime path.

  `--strict-tokens` did nothing. cac parsed it, the interactive prompt asked for it, and the init action destructured
  every other flag — so a project that asked for strict tokens got a config without the key, with nothing said. The flag
  is in the CLI reference, which made it worse: the only way to find out was to write a misspelled token and wait for a
  report that never came. It now reaches the generated config, and takes the middle mode too:
  `bamboo init --strict-tokens unknown-tokens`, which was otherwise a config-file feature `init` could not produce. As
  before, `init` writes nothing when a config already exists unless `--force` is passed, so the flag applies to the
  config it creates.

  An unrecognised value is refused rather than coerced. Mapping the unknown to `true` would make `--strict-tokens=false`
  turn it _on_, and a typo in the middle mode's name pick the strictest setting there is — every raw CSS value in the
  project becoming a type error with nothing naming the mistake. `false`, `no`, `off` and an empty value are all read as
  off.

  A config that names a setting which does not exist is now reported too. `strictTokens: 'unknown'` reached the
  generated types as a comparison against two known values and emitted a _fourth_ prop shape that no setting asks for,
  from a build that exited 0.

  The interactive prompt's first question — "Would you like to use PostCSS?" — defaulted to yes for every project. That
  is the choice between an integration that compiles your style calls away and one that ships the style engine to the
  client, and both render identically, so pressing Enter picked the heavier one and nothing afterwards said so. It now
  defaults from the project: a Vite config means `@bamboocss/vite` is available and the answer is no, unless the project
  is Svelte, Vue or Astro, whose components the compiler does not transform. The wording says what the question decides
  rather than naming the tool.

  The strict-tokens prompt offers the three modes rather than yes/no, and `InitFlags` declares what `interactive()`
  returns — the missing field behind an `as` cast is what let the answer be dropped in the first place.

### Minor Changes

- 4c66fdb: Say when a Vite project is emitting the stylesheet through PostCSS, which silently ships the style engine.

  `@bamboocss/postcss` emits CSS and nothing else. Under it, `css()` and `cva()` stay runtime calls and the generated
  style engine goes out in the client bundle — where `@bamboocss/vite` compiles those calls to literal class strings and
  ships no engine at all. Nothing about the result distinguishes the two: the stylesheet is correct, the app renders,
  and the engine is the only difference — 20 kB of client JavaScript in one reported app. Bamboo's own React Router
  guide described the PostCSS setup, so projects reached it by following the docs rather than by choosing it.

  Both entry points now say so. `bamboo init --postcss` warns when the directory already has a Vite config, and the
  PostCSS plugin warns once per project when it runs in one — suppressed when a Bamboo source compiler is loaded in the
  same process, so a project that has both installed is not told off for the setup it already has. Pass
  `{ runtimeStyling: true }` to the plugin where resolving styles at runtime is deliberate.

  A Svelte, Vue or Astro project is the exception and is never warned: `@bamboocss/vite` compiles JavaScript and
  TypeScript, and their components are templates it leaves alone — moving one onto it would prune every rule only those
  components reach. The React Router guide now uses `@bamboocss/vite`, and the other Vite-framework guides say which
  integration they are describing.

## 1.37.2

### Patch Changes

- 35a689c: Fix three things a multi-environment build, a watch rebuild, and a racing delete each broke.

  **An SSR environment no longer fails the build.** `buildStart` fires once per environment, and it reset the whole
  compilation session each time — so a framework building a client and an SSR bundle against one plugin instance had the
  second discard everything the first established. `cssLoaded` went false, and an SSR bundle that legitimately never
  imports the stylesheet (the client build emits it) failed the "not imported" check outright. The reset now happens per
  _run_: seeing the same environment twice is what marks a new one. The lost-stylesheet guard is likewise scoped to the
  environment that actually served the sheet, since only that one can lose it.

  **A watch rebuild sweeps files it no longer generates.** `prune` ran only when the artifact list was unfiltered, and
  every incremental rebuild passes a filter — so a pattern dropped from the config left its generated module behind,
  resolving and returning class names for rules that no longer existed. Pruning now recomputes the complete list rather
  than reading the written subset as the whole truth. A `codegen:prepare` hook that returns a subset still suppresses
  it, because nothing can tell that apart from a hook adding artifacts.

  **A file disappearing mid-build is skipped rather than fatal.** A file can vanish between being globbed and being read
  — a watch rebuild racing a delete, a branch switch. It has no styles left to contribute, so it is not a build to fail.
  Only `ENOENT` is swallowed.

  Note on the second: recomputing the full artifact list costs work on every filtered rebuild that previously skipped
  it. That is deliberate — a stale generated module that still resolves is worse than a slower rebuild.

### Minor Changes

- 9bfcf31: Replace Vite's runtime styling and named-recipe output with mandatory whole-program compilation.

  The compiler resolves `css`, `cva`, `sva`, config recipes, static `viewTransition` bags, and statically analyzable
  `cx` composition before allocating classes. Recipe identity no longer enters declaration identity, so identical
  declarations share one global atom across every API and source file. Production builds omit recipe layers, prune
  unreachable graph atoms and transition rules, compile finite runtime recipe selections into reduced decision tables,
  and use deterministic or build-local compact class names. Compilation now runs in development too, and unresolved
  runtime styling is always an error. The former transform, partial-folding, runtime-fallback, and opt-in compatibility
  options have been removed.

### Minor Changes

- c527ea7: Fail the build on a call to a binding the pattern or recipe entrypoint no longer exports.

  ```
  error: 1 call(s) name a binding that does not exist:

  src/modal.tsx
    `stack` is not a pattern — `../styled-system/patterns` does not export it.

  Both entrypoints are generated from your config, so what they export moves when it does — a pattern
  dropped from a preset, a recipe renamed. The call survives that as a binding to nothing: nothing
  extracts it, so every rule it would have contributed is absent from the stylesheet and the classes
  their components ask for have nothing behind them.
  ```

  Both entrypoints are generated from the config, so what they export moves when it does. The import survives that as a
  binding to nothing — `isValidPattern` declines it, so it never reaches `patternAliases`, `matchFn` declines every call
  of it, and the extractor records nothing. The call site is still there and still asks for a class.

  Removing one pattern took eleven selectors out of a release this way, along with every modal's spacing and width.
  Codegen printed four ticks and exited 0; it was found by diffing selector sets before and after. That is the outcome
  `assertExtracted` already fails on, reached from the other direction, so it now reports the same way — every file
  named in one pass, dropped once the file is fixed, deleted, or leaves `include`, and surviving the incremental passes
  that skip an unchanged file.

  **Reported per call, not per import.** Both entrypoints export types beside their functions — `FlexProperties` from
  `patterns`, `ButtonVariantProps` from `recipes` — and neither is a pattern or a recipe, so an import-only test reports
  every file that types a prop. TypeScript lets those be written without the `type` keyword and elides them either way,
  so the keyword is not a filter this can rely on. A type is never called, which is. A binding nobody calls is left
  alone for the same reason: nothing asked it for a class, so no rule is missing.

  Not governed by a severity option, unlike `unresolvedToken`. That one infers a mistake from a value's shape and can be
  wrong about a literal; this is read off the entrypoint's own export list.

### Patch Changes

- c49ab36: Cap the diagnostic lists, and group a dead call by the binding rather than by the file.

  A build error's job is to name the mistake, and every list in one was joined whole. A pattern dropped from a preset
  and called across an app produced **400 identical blocks and 1,221 lines of stderr** carrying one line of information,
  with the paragraph explaining the failure scrolled off the top. The same error is now six lines:

  ```txt
  ERR_BAMBOO_DEAD_IMPORT: 400 call(s) name a binding that does not exist:

  `stack` is not a pattern — `../styled-system/patterns` does not export it.
    400 file(s): src/comp-0.tsx, src/comp-1.tsx, src/comp-10.tsx, src/comp-100.tsx, src/comp-101.tsx, … and 395 more

  Both entrypoints are generated from your config, so what they export moves when it does — …
  ```

  Grouping is by the binding because that is the unit of the mistake; two distinct dead bindings stay two findings.
  Files within a group are deduplicated, since one module can call the same one twice.

  The other three unbounded lists are capped rather than grouped, each carrying a distinct message with nothing to
  collapse: files that could not be extracted, unresolved token values (25, being one line each), and the
  `failOnUnfolded` survivor list. In every case the count is of what was withheld, and a list that fits is joined
  exactly as before.

  `truncateList` and `groupBy` are exported from `@bamboocss/shared`.

- e66c5f8: Delete artifacts codegen no longer generates, instead of leaving them on disk.

  Codegen was write-only. An artifact that stopped being produced stayed where it was: dropping a pattern from the
  config rewrote `patterns/index.mjs` without it and left `patterns/stack.mjs` beside it. Importing through the barrel
  then failed loudly, which is fine — a deep import resolved, ran, returned a class name and emitted no css. A stale
  artifact is worse than a missing one, because it answers.

  `--clean` was the only sweep, and it empties the whole directory rather than reconciling it.

  Bounded twice over, because the cost of being wrong is a deleted file rather than a stale one. Only the directories a
  codegen actually wrote to are read, so a directory bamboo does not generate into is never touched. Within them, only
  files carrying an extension this codegen wrote _there_ are eligible: `patterns/` received `.mjs` and `.d.ts` files, so
  a leftover `stack.mjs` is stale, while a `.gitignore`, a `README.md` or a `styles.css` is not the kind of thing bamboo
  puts there and is none of its business. Subdirectories are left alone.

  Reasoning from what was written, rather than from a list of known exceptions. A denylist has to name every file
  someone might legitimately keep in an output directory, and the failure mode when it misses one is silent deletion —
  it missed the `.gitignore` that ships inside a generated directory.

  Skipped for a partial codegen and for a `codegen:prepare` hook that replaced the artifact list — neither can say what
  a directory should contain, and reading a filtered list as the whole truth would delete every artifact it held back.

- 10bf63d: Keep a `@keyframes` for as long as the token declaration naming it ships.

  ```css
  --animations-drawer-in-right: slide-in-right 400ms ease-out; /* shipped */
  /* @keyframes slide-in-right — deleted */
  ```

  `pruneTokenVars` roots reachability at what the css references _plus_ what reaches a token from outside it: a
  `token()` call, a `prune.keepTokens` pattern, a theme artifact injected at runtime, a `globalCss` export.
  `pruneKeyframes` asked the same question of the same sheet a moment later and re-derived it from the css alone, which
  can see none of those. So a token one pass kept had its keyframe deleted by the other, leaving a declaration pointing
  at a definition that is not there. The stylesheet is valid, the build exits 0, and the animation simply never plays —
  the failure only a diff of the output finds.

  The token pass now hands its answer to the keyframe pass rather than each computing its own. A keyframe is dropped
  only when the declarations naming it were dropped too, so the pass keeps its saving: on the default preset an app that
  uses no animations still ships none of them, and its css is byte-identical to before.

  **It was reported as depending on whether `include` covers `outdir`, which is a second route to it rather than the
  cause.** `collectKeyframeReferences` scans source text for each declared name, and the generated token artifact
  contains `slide-in-right 400ms` verbatim — so a project whose `include` reaches its own output was keeping its
  keyframes by accident, and excluding `outdir` took the accident away. That overlap is no longer load-bearing for
  keyframes.

  Under `prune: { tokens: 'off' }` every keyframe a declaration names is now kept. Nothing is removable there, and `off`
  is the setting chosen precisely because something outside the stylesheet reads those declarations.

- 09d4203: Stop reporting unresolved styles in files bamboo generated.

  ```
  warn [css] styled-system/css/css.mjs:48:36 — an object spread or computed key leaves the
  build unable to tell which properties this call sets.
  ```

  `include` conventionally covers a source tree that `outdir` sits inside — `./src/**` and `src/styled-system` — so the
  build routinely parses its own output. The generated `css.mjs` defines `cssLeaf` as `css({ [prop]: value })`, a
  computed key and so unenumerable by construction, and that warned on every build of every such project. There was no
  edit that would silence it: the file is regenerated from bamboo's own template.

  That is worse than noise. It sits in the same channel as the losses that do matter and have fixes — an unresolvable
  value, a recipe whose hash the browser will not agree with — and a line that is always there teaches everyone reading
  the log to skip the channel.

  Suppressed at the report rather than by dropping the directory from the scan, because that overlap is load-bearing
  elsewhere: the token and keyframe reference scans read whatever `include` covers. Authored source is reported exactly
  as before.

## 1.33.0

### Minor Changes

- f7bbc14: Move `prune.preflight` onto `preflight`, so one key owns the reset.

  ```ts
  preflight: { scope: '.app', prune: true } // was preflight: { scope: '.app' }, prune: { preflight: true }
  ```

  There were two config keys named `preflight`, one level apart, and a config had to set both to prune a scoped reset —
  asking for the reset in one place and reshaping it in another. They were never independent: pruning reads
  `preflight.scope` to strip the scope before an element can be read out of a selector, and without that the pass
  matches nothing and silently removes nothing.

  `preflight: true` still means on with the defaults, and is _not_ pruned — pruning stays opt-in, since unlike the token
  and keyframe passes there is nothing to prove it against. `scope` is now optional, which it already was at runtime.

  A config still setting `prune.preflight` fails with the edit to make, rather than reverting to the default in silence.
  That matters more here than for most removals: the reset keeps being emitted either way, just unpruned, so nothing
  about the output would have said the setting had stopped being read.

### Minor Changes

- c29044f: Fail the build when a file cannot be extracted, instead of logging it and exiting 0.

  ```
  error during build:
  [bamboocss:css] Could not load virtual:bamboo.css: 1 file(s) could not be extracted:

  src/Timeline.tsx
    `{colors.brand.purple/35}` in the value `0 0 0 2px {colors.brand.purple/35}` is the retired
    token reference syntax. Write `token(colors.brand.purple/35)` instead.

  Nothing emits a rule for a file the build could not read, so every style in these is absent from
  the stylesheet and the classes their components ask for have nothing behind them.
  ```

  Extraction caught, logged, and carried on. The file's styles never reach the encoder, so every rule it would have
  contributed is simply gone — one retired token spelling in one component dropped that component's css and left a green
  build behind it. Three error-level lines, exit 0, and `built` printed at the end.

  **The two integrations disagreed about the same source.** `bamboo cssgen` exited 1 on a file it could not extract,
  because it went through the one entry point that let the throw out; every bundler build went through the one that
  caught it. CI running a build passed what CI running `cssgen` rejected. Both now go through the same path, so the
  question is settled once rather than per integration.

  Every broken file is named in one error rather than the first one aborting the pass, and a failure is keyed by file so
  it survives the incremental passes that skip an unchanged one — otherwise a rebuild of identical, still-broken source
  came back green. It is dropped once the file parses, is deleted, or leaves `include`, since a context outlives
  rebuilds and all three of those are fixes. A watch rebuild still reports and keeps watching; only a build fails.

  **`failOnUnfolded` counts a module the fold threw on.** A throw in the vite transform was caught and the module
  returned unchanged, which is safe — its runtime call still works — but it landed in neither the folded column nor the
  declined one. The coverage summary reported 100% over the files that did not throw, and the survivor check saw a file
  that was never there, so the option's whole guarantee held vacuously over it. It now reports as `fold-failed`. Unknown
  counts as survives: the claim is that _nothing_ still calls `css()`, and a module nobody could look at cannot support
  it. Without `failOnUnfolded` it stays a logged error and a declined module, as before.

- b0ed6dc: Remove the top-level `hooks` config option, so a hook has one place to live.

  Hooks were registrable two ways — through `plugins`, or through a bare `hooks` key on the config, which was treated as
  a nameless plugin appended after all the others. Write a plugin:

  ```ts
  export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
      {
        name: 'my-app',
        hooks: {
          'tokens:created': ({ configure }) => configure({ formatTokenName: (path) => '$' + path.join('-') }),
        },
      },
    ],
  })
  ```

  One mechanism with two spellings also meant an ordering rule you had to know — "plugins in sequence, then the config's
  own last" — and a diagnostic layer that had a name to print for one spelling and nothing for the other. Ordering is
  now just the order of the array, and every hook belongs to something named.

  A config still setting `hooks` fails naming the replacement, like any other removed option, rather than reverting to
  the default in silence.

  Internally the merged hooks no longer travel on the config object. They were written onto it by `mergeConfigs` and
  read back off in `resolveConfig`, which is what made a `hooks` key ambiguous between "what you wrote" and "what
  resolution produced"; `plugins` is the only source, so `resolveConfig` merges them once and keeps them on
  `LoadConfigResult`. `createContext` from `@bamboocss/fixture` reads hooks from `plugins` for the same reason.

- 591a0f1: Remove `cssgen --minimal`, leaving the artifact type as the one way to say what `cssgen` emits.

  `cssgen <type>` names one of `preflight`, `tokens`, `static`, `global` or `keyframes`. `--minimal` answered the same
  question from the other side — everything _except_ those five — so which flag you reached for depended on which side
  of the set you were standing on.

  To ship only the css your source uses, generate everything and import the part you want. `--splitting` writes each
  layer as its own file:

  ```bash
  bamboo cssgen --splitting
  ```

  ```
  styled-system/styles/utilities.css   # what --minimal emitted
  styled-system/styles/recipes.css
  ```

  That costs the generation of the layers you then do not import, which is build time rather than shipped bytes.

- c29044f: Add `prune.keepTokens`, so a token path the build cannot follow costs a category instead of the whole theme.

  ```ts
  prune: { tokens: 'accounted', keepTokens: ['colors.*'] }
  ```

  `accounted`'s fallback was total: **one** reference the accounting could not follow kept every declaration in the
  project, so a codebase with a single `token(key)` in it shipped the same stylesheet as one that never pruned. There
  was no middle ground between that and asserting every path resolves — which put the feature out of reach of the
  codebases that reach for `token()` most.

  `keepTokens` is the bound the build could not infer, written by hand. Under `accounted` it keeps what it matches
  **and** stands in for what could not be followed, in place of the blanket keep. Measured on `sandbox/vite-ts` with one
  unfollowable `token(key)`:

  | setting                                             | declarations | stylesheet |
  | --------------------------------------------------- | -----------: | ---------: |
  | `tokens: 'reachable'`                               |          426 |   23,412 B |
  | `tokens: 'accounted'`                               |          426 |   23,412 B |
  | `tokens: 'accounted', keepTokens: ['colors.*']`     |          270 |   17,867 B |
  | `tokens: 'accounted', keepTokens: ['colors.red.*']` |           51 |   10,649 B |

  Patterns are anchored globs over the dotted token _path_, with `*` for any run of characters and a leading `!` to
  exclude. The path, not the css variable: a token is `fontSizes.3xl` and its declaration is `--font-sizes-3xl`, so
  `font-sizes.*` matches nothing. A pattern matching no token is reported and names the spelling that would have worked,
  because it is nearly always a typo and keeping nothing is otherwise silent; so is a list holding only exclusions,
  which selects everything they do not name.

  Saying `keepTokens: ['colors.*']` is an assertion about your own code — _the reads you cannot follow land in colours_
  — which is why nothing infers it. Nothing verifies it either, so the covered references are still printed under
  `warn`. `unresolvedPath: 'error'` deliberately does **not** combine with it: one asserts every path resolves and the
  other declares where the ones that do not will land, and the build says which to drop rather than silently preferring
  the weaker claim.

  Under `reachable` it is additive only, for a token nothing in the stylesheet references and no javascript here reads —
  a sibling package consuming the output, or css outside `include`.

  This replaces `staticCss` as the way to keep a token category alive. `staticCss` emits utility _classes_: keeping the
  colours meant shipping a rule per colour purely to hold the declarations up, usually a larger stylesheet than the
  pruning saved. `CssRule.properties` also has no documented wildcard, so every value had to be enumerated by hand.

  **Docs.** The `prune` reference had not caught up with the option renames — it documented `prune.unresolved`,
  `tokens: false` and the wrong default for `unresolvedPath`. It also never mentioned that a template literal is
  **bounded rather than declined**: ``token(`colors.${shade}`)`` keeps the `colors` category and prunes everything else,
  which already covers the commonest dynamic read and is worth knowing before concluding `accounted` is unusable.

- b2b4173: Rebuild the themes artifact when a theme variant changes, and carry the original errors on a failed
  extraction.

  **`theme.variants` rebuilt nothing.** The watch rebuild decides which artifacts to regenerate by matching the changed
  config path against a per-artifact list, and the themes artifact still watched `themes` — the option's name before it
  became `theme.variants`. `ConfigPath` ends in `(string & {})`, so the stale path typechecked and simply stopped
  matching.

  Nothing reported it. The diff saw the change, no matcher claimed it, and the affected set came back empty — which is
  not "rebuild everything": `getMatchingArtifacts` filters on `ids.includes(...)`, and an empty list includes nothing.
  So editing or adding a theme variant regenerated no artifact at all and kept serving the previous `theme-*.json`.
  `eject` was stale in the same list, left by the same round of renames.

  A test now checks every watched path against the removed-option table, so an option that is renamed and not updated
  here fails at the commit that renames it rather than silently detaching an artifact from its trigger.

  **`ERR_BAMBOO_EXTRACT_FAILED` carries its causes.** The aggregate named every file it could not extract but kept only
  their messages, so a caller acting on the failure could not tell a retired token spelling from a syntax error. It now
  sets `cause` to an `AggregateError` of the originals — always, one file or six, so reading `cause.errors` never has to
  test how many there were first.

## 1.31.0

### Minor Changes

- 8fb87ac: **Config options are renamed and removed in this release.** It ships as a minor, so nothing in the version
  signals it — the migration notes below are the warning. Every removed or renamed option is reported by name on the
  next build, with the edit to make.

  Settle the config surface before the API freezes: remove the options that were a second way to say something the
  config already said, and rename the ones whose names disagreed with each other.

  Every removed or renamed option is reported by name on the next build, with the edit to make. An unknown key is
  otherwise ignored in silence, which would mean the build reverting to a default without saying so.

  **`strict` now means exactly one thing.** It was six options across three packages covering three unrelated concerns.
  `strictTokens` and `strictPropertyValues` are unchanged and are the only remaining use of the word — both narrow
  generated TypeScript and neither affects a build.
  - `vite.strict` → `vite.failOnUnfolded`. Named for what it checks.
  - `PatternConfig.strict` + `PatternConfig.blocklist` → `PatternConfig.cssProps: 'all' | 'none' | { except }`. These
    were two answers to one question, and setting both silently dropped the blocklist — it is only applied to the type
    that `strict: true` does not emit.
  - `validation: 'none'` → `validation: 'off'`, matching `prune`.

  **`prune` separates the strategy from the report.**
  - `prune.tokens` takes `'off' | 'reachable' | 'accounted'` instead of a boolean.
  - `prune.unresolved` → `prune.unresolvedPath`, and is now orthogonal: the accounting pass is `tokens: 'accounted'`,
    the severity is `unresolvedPath`. `'off'` used to mean both "do not account" and "do not report", which left
    "account, and stay quiet" unsayable.
  - `prune.propertyRegistrations` is new. Dropping unreachable `@property` registrations was a side effect of
    `prune.tokens`, and happened even when it was off — so an option documented as keeping every token declaration
    quietly removed something else, and nothing could keep them.

  **Four `global*` keys become one.** `globalCss`, `globalFontface`, `globalPositionTry` and `globalVars` are
  `global.css`, `global.fontface`, `global.positionTry` and `global.vars`. `globalVars` was the one of the four
  `PresetCore` never listed, so it kept its `extend` wrapper in the resolved config while its siblings lost theirs.

  **`themes` becomes `theme.variants`.** One character from `theme`, both spellings valid, so the typo resolved to a
  different feature rather than to an error.

  **`presets` is authoritative.** What the config lists is what is loaded; an unset `presets` loads `defaultPresets`,
  exported from `@bamboocss/dev/presets`. `eject` is removed — `presets: []` is what it meant. Previously, listing any
  preset kept `@bamboocss/preset-base` and silently dropped `@bamboocss/preset-bamboo`, so `presets` was neither
  additive nor replacing, and `presets: []` meant "base only" rather than "none". A config that lists presets without
  `preset-base` now warns, because the change is otherwise silent: `preset-base` carries the utility table, so dropping
  it changes every generated class name rather than raising an error.

  ```ts
  import { defaultPresets } from '@bamboocss/dev/presets'

  export default defineConfig({ presets: [...defaultPresets, myPreset] })
  ```

  **`lightningcss` is removed; list the plugin instead.** Its only job was to push `pluginLightningcss()` into
  `plugins`. Naming the plugin from inside `@bamboocss/node` made it a static import, so
  `@bamboocss/plugin-lightningcss` — and the `lightningcss` native binary behind it — installed with every project
  whether or not the flag was set. It is a separate package so that cost can be opt-in.

  ```ts
  import { pluginLightningcss } from '@bamboocss/plugin-lightningcss'

  export default defineConfig({ plugins: [pluginLightningcss()] })
  ```

  **Fixes**
  - `validation` no longer switches off removed-option detection. Setting it to `'none'` returned before that check ran,
    so the one mechanism that tells an upgrader their setting is no longer read was disabled by a severity setting.
  - `forceConsistentTypeExtension` now emits import specifiers as `./x.mjs` rather than `./x.d.mts`, which is only legal
    under `allowImportingTsExtensions`. The flag previously emitted imports that did not resolve.

- 8fb87ac: Declare the generated output's entry points in its `package.json`, so `node16`/`nodenext` resolve them and
  the modules behind them stop being importable.

  `styled-system/tokens` did not resolve under those modes at all. They do no directory-index lookup and the file
  declared no `exports`, so the artifact had to be spelled `styled-system/tokens/index.mjs` — a workaround the token
  scanner still has to recognise because projects have it written down. Both spellings resolve now.

  The map also states the boundary: `./css`, `./tokens`, `./types`, `./patterns`, `./recipes`, `./themes`,
  `./styles.css`, `./styles/*` and `./specs/*` are the output. `css/merge-css`, `css/utilities`, `tokens/tokens` and
  `helpers` exist for the modules beside them and are no longer reachable from outside. A relative import within the
  generated directory is unaffected.

  This enforces where the output is resolved as a package — the component-library layout `emit-pkg` produces. It cannot
  enforce against a `paths` alias like `"styled-system/*": ["./styled-system/*"]`, which resolves straight to the
  filesystem without consulting `exports`; there the map documents intent rather than imposing it.

  `emit-pkg` now derives its map from the same builder instead of restating it. That copy had drifted: it advertised a
  `require` condition pointing at `.mjs`, for output that is ESM under every setting, and listed `./types` as a runtime
  entry for a directory holding only declarations.

- cd5954c: Group the three prune flags under `prune`, and rename the mode that was called `'strict'`.

  ```ts
  // before
  pruneUnusedTokens: 'strict'
  pruneUnusedKeyframes: false
  prunePreflight: true

  // after
  prune: { unresolved: 'error', keyframes: false, preflight: true }
  ```

  Three options for one concept had drifted apart on all three of naming, default and value type: two said "Unused" and
  one did not, two defaulted to `true` and one to `false`, one took a string and two did not. Each key is independent
  and setting one keeps the defaults for the rest.

  **`'strict'` is now `unresolved: 'error'`.** The word already meant something unrelated in the same config —
  `strictTokens` and `strictPropertyValues` narrow generated _typescript_, and neither implies nor is implied by failing
  a build over a token path. The option is now named for what it checks.

  **`unresolved: 'warn'` is new.** It runs the same accounting as `'error'` and reports the same references without
  failing the build, so a project can read what turning `'error'` on would reject before a build depends on the answer.
  The pruning is identical either way — only whether an unreadable path stops the build differs.

  **Upgrading.** A config still setting a removed option is now reported by name, with the replacement:

  ```
  ⚠️ Invalid config:
  - [config] `pruneUnusedTokens: 'strict'` is now `prune: { unresolved: 'error' }`.
  ```

  That check exists because an unknown config key was otherwise ignored in **silence** — there is no schema walk, so a
  stale `pruneUnusedTokens: 'strict'` would have built clean, pruned by the default instead, and quietly stopped
  enforcing the assertion it asked for. Set `validation: 'error'` to make it fail rather than warn.

  Emitted css is unchanged for an equivalent config; verified byte-identical on three example apps.

  Preset merging is per key: a preset setting `prune: { keyframes: false }` and an app setting
  `prune: { preflight: true }` get both. That needed doing deliberately — `mergeConfigs` deep-merges only the options it
  names and shallow-assigns the rest, so nesting three booleans into an object introduced a way for a preset's setting
  to vanish because an app set a _different_ key. Nothing about the output would have shown it, so it is pinned by a
  test.

- 9fdce28: One way to reference a token from a string: `token(colors.red.300)`. The curly form is gone.

  ```ts
  // before — both worked, and meant the same thing
  css({ color: '{colors.red.300}' })
  css({ color: 'token(colors.red.300)' })

  // after
  css({ color: 'token(colors.red.300)' })
  ```

  The same everywhere a reference can appear: theme and semantic token values, conditions, media queries, style values.

  `token()` was kept rather than `{…}` because it is the readable one — it reads as what it is, it can be searched for,
  and it is already the name of the javascript api that does the same job. Keeping braces would have left the concept
  with two names, one of which is punctuation.

  It also had a hole that made the choice easy: in a theme or semantic token value, `token(colors.red.300)` was never
  expanded at all. It landed in the emitted stylesheet as literal text — invalid css, no warning. That is fixed. The
  fallback form in a theme value, `token(colors.red.300, blue)`, is still not expanded; that is unchanged by this
  release and remains a known gap.

  **Upgrading.** A curly reference left behind does not fail loudly. In a style value the declaration is dropped; in a
  theme value the literal text is emitted. Nothing warns, and config validation cannot report it either, since it is no
  longer a reference to check. Search your config and styles for `{` followed by a token path.

  Emitted css does not change. What changes is that a class name derived from a value containing a reference now spells
  it `token(…)`, since class names encode the value as authored. Verified byte-identical on two real projects, one of
  them a theme with 39 references.

  Token pruning had to be taught the difference between the two things now spelled `token(`. The gate that decides
  whether javascript can reach a token is a text scan, and a reference inside a css value —
  `css({ border: '1px solid token(colors.red.300)' })` — is not javascript reaching a token. Reading it as one turned
  pruning off wholesale, which measured 3.2x the stylesheet on a sandbox: 246 colour declarations where 11 were used. A
  `token(` that survives blanking every string literal is a call; one that does not was written inside a string.

  Config validation understands the new spelling too. It carries its own copy of the reference regex, because it is the
  thing that reports a missing or circular reference — a spelling only the dictionary understood would have been silence
  rather than an error.

  The fallback form is otherwise unchanged: `token(spacing.4, 4)` still means "this token, or this literal if there is
  no such token", which is how the `bleed`, `divider` and `container` patterns accept either a token name or a raw css
  value.

## 1.30.1

### Patch Changes

- 2634909: Cover `pruneUnusedTokens: 'strict'` against a real stylesheet, and pin that a failed rebuild reports itself.

  Every existing test of the flag stubbed `pruneTokens` and asserted the arguments it was handed, which proves the
  accounting decided correctly and nothing about what ships. No example app sets the flag either, so the path had never
  run against a real sheet — which is why a throw swallowed by the file watcher survived to a reviewer: nothing executed
  the code, only its inputs.

  The new tests build a real sheet, prune it, and read the css: a resolved path keeps its token and drops the rest, a
  bounded path keeps its category, an unresolvable path fails the build, and no `var()` in the surviving stylesheet is
  left without a declaration behind it. The watch case is driven through `watchFiles` with a fake emitter, because the
  defect lived in the wiring — a test of the extracted catch passes with that wiring deleted.

  Still not covered, since a reader would otherwise assume it is: parser css never runs here, so recipe, slot and
  composition layers are absent, and the non-failing decline branch — the warn-and-defer path that makes `strict` safe
  to offer — has no css-level assertion.

## 1.30.0

### Minor Changes

- Remove `token.var()` and the token `fallback` parameter.

  `token.var` was `token.var = token` — a literal alias, so two spellings for one behaviour, which is the redundancy the
  `token()` change exists to remove. `token()` is the reference.

  The second `fallback` argument is gone too: `token(path) ?? fallback` says the same thing in the language, and the
  parameter had to be proved side-effect-free before a build could fold the call away. A path naming no token resolves
  to nothing, and the property is dropped — at build time and at runtime alike, which they did not previously agree on.

  `token()` and `token.value()` return `string`. Their parameters are the closed sets of paths the theme declares, so a
  call that typechecks always answers.

- 009294f: Bound a dynamic token path by its static prefix instead of keeping every declaration.

  Under `pruneUnusedTokens: 'strict'`, ``token(`colors.${shade}`)`` used to be reported as unresolvable, which keeps the
  whole token layer — 468 declarations on the default preset against 68 for the old, narrower exemption. Bamboo cannot
  tell which token that call wants, but it can tell which it _cannot_: everything the expression produces starts
  `colors.`. It now keeps that category and prunes the rest.

  The static head was already sitting in the source and was thrown away. It is the shape the documentation site itself
  uses, and the only genuinely dynamic token call in this repository.

  A head that bounds nothing — ``token(`${path}`)`` — is still reported, and still keeps everything.

- 242b24c: `pruneUnusedTokens: 'strict'` now fails the build on a reference it cannot resolve, instead of warning.

  `strict` is an assertion — you are stating that every token path in the project resolves at build time. When that
  turned out to be false it printed a warning and quietly kept every token declaration, which leaves you believing the
  layer was pruned when it was not. That is the same silence the flag exists to remove.

  Only that one fails. Everything else is **reported** and keeps the layer exactly as the default would — a `.vue` or
  `.svelte` component stored post-transform, a file it could not parse, a barrel it cannot classify, a dynamic
  `import()`. Those reasons exist because declining used to be free, so the accounting declined anything it could not
  prove; several of them have nothing to do with tokens, and failing a build over a route-splitting `import()` would be
  indefensible.

  A failed _rebuild_ now reports itself too. A throw inside a watch callback was discarded by the file watcher, surfaced
  as an internal `Unhandled rejection`, left the exit code at 0, and was invisible at `logLevel: 'silent'`.

  The error is `TOKEN_REFERENCE_UNRESOLVED`, and names every unresolved reference with its file and line.

## 1.29.0

### Minor Changes

- 0dbe9c4: Add `pruneUnusedTokens: 'strict'`, which prunes the token layer for projects whose token paths all resolve at
  build time.

  Since `token()` returns a css variable reference for every token, a path the build cannot read could name any of them,
  so every declaration has to be kept — and the check for that is all-or-nothing: one token call or `/tokens` import
  anywhere under `include` keeps the lot. On the default preset that is 468 declarations instead of 68.

  `'strict'` is an assertion rather than a cleverer inference. You state that every token path is spelled out at the
  call; Bamboo accounts for each reference, keeps by name only what is asked for, and prints everything it could not
  read:

  ```
  ⚠ tokens:strict  2 token reference(s) could not be resolved, so every token declaration is kept.

    src/chart.tsx
      14: unresolved-reference
    src/theme.ts
      3: unclassified-import
  ```

  A reference it cannot read is never pruned — it falls back to whatever the default would have answered for that
  project. So `strict` is never less safe and never larger than the default, and it says why when it cannot prune.

  Two things keep it inert rather than wrong: any file whose parsed tree carries syntax errors declines, which includes
  every `.ts` file using a generic arrow (`<T>(x: T) => x`) or an old-style assertion, since Bamboo hands every file to
  the parser as TSX; and a `.vue` or `.svelte` file mentioning `token` anywhere declines, because a single-file
  component is stored post-transform and the tree is not the code that ships.

  What resolves: a string literal path, either half (`token`, `token.var`, `token.value`), an aliased import, a
  namespace import. What is reported: a path built at runtime or from a constant, a binding that escapes
  (`const t = token`), a re-export, a `require`, and an import from a module Bamboo cannot classify as the artifact —
  which covers a barrel re-exporting it.

  The one thing it cannot check is a caller **outside** `include`, since that scopes style extraction rather than
  everything that may import. Confirm `include` covers every file reaching for a token before turning this on; the
  default remains unchanged.

- 38393c4: `token()` now returns the css variable reference for every token, and `token.value()` returns the resolved
  literal.

  ```ts
  token('colors.red.300') // "var(--colors-red-300)"  — was "#fca5a5"
  token.value('colors.red.300') // "#fca5a5"
  token.var('colors.red.300') // unchanged; now an alias of token()
  ```

  **Why.** `token()` used to return the literal for a plain token and the variable reference for a virtual or
  conditional one, so the kind of thing you got back was decided by the theme rather than by the call. Adding a `_dark`
  variant to a token silently changed what every caller received — same call, same path, a colour before and a variable
  after, both typed `string`, with nothing to catch it. Always-a-reference is the predictable half and the one that
  keeps responding to the cascade, so it takes the short name; the literal has to be asked for, which is also the honest
  signal, since it is the form that stops tracking the theme.

  `token.value()` keeps the old per-token split rather than always returning a literal: a virtual or conditional token
  has no single literal, so its `var()` is still the only truthful answer.

  **Migrating.** Rename any call whose result goes somewhere a css variable will not resolve — a `<canvas>` fill, a
  charting library, `<meta name="theme-color">`, or arithmetic on the value — to `token.value()`. Everything else can
  stay as it is and gets better behaviour for free. Nothing throws and no type changes, since both forms return
  `string`, so this is worth grepping for rather than waiting on.

  **Extraction and folding.** `token()`, `token.var()` and `token.value()` are all recognised by the parser and folded
  at build time, including paths built from a constant or template literal the extractor can follow. `token()` is now
  the trivially foldable form: no condition to read and no non-string case to decline.

  **Fixed along the way: negative tokens lost their sign.** A negative token has no css variable of its own — its
  `varRef` names the positive counterpart, and the negation survives only in the value — so a token whose positive
  counterpart carried a condition resolved to a _positive_ length. `token.value('spacing.-gutter')` returned
  `var(--spacing-gutter)` where it should return `calc(var(--spacing-gutter) * -1)`. Both halves now read through the
  token view, so the generated runtime, the extractor and the build-time fold cannot disagree.

  **Stylesheet size.** This makes `pruneUnusedTokens` coarser in one case. Because `token()` can hand back a `var()` for
  any token, a project that reaches for a token from javascript at all now keeps every token declaration, where before
  it kept only the virtual, conditional and negative ones. A project that never imports the tokens artifact is
  unaffected, and one whose paths all resolve statically will be too once the reachability gate is narrowed to
  distinguish them — tracked as follow-up work.

### Patch Changes

- 5e6eafe: Read each source file once per build, and always ignore declaration files.

  The keep set, the reachability gate and the `strict` accounting all want the same two copies of the same files, and
  each fetched them itself. A strict build therefore opened every file three times — once to collect references, once to
  account, and once more for the gate whenever the accounting declined. They now share one walk. Pinned by counting
  reads rather than timing them, so it runs in CI.

  `**/*.d.ts` is now always ignored by the source glob. It used to be a _default_ that a project's own `exclude`
  replaced, so whether declaration files were scanned came down to whether the project happened to set an unrelated
  option: `exclude: []` ignored them, `exclude: ['**/*.stories.tsx']` scanned them. A declaration file carries no
  runtime code and can emit no styles; it was only ever read by the deliberately over-inclusive reference scans, where
  it could keep a token named in a doc comment. Half of projects got that and half did not, by accident.

- a137758: Fix a watch rebuild keeping `@property` registrations a full build strips.

  `pruneUnusedTokens: false` still drops the `@property` registrations a preset's utilities declare — those are not
  tokens and the reachability problem the flag exists for does not apply to them. Three of the four build paths did
  that; the watch rebuild skipped `pruneTokens` entirely, so the stylesheet you developed against carried a preset's
  whole filter and gradient set while the one you shipped did not.

  The conditional was written out four times, and two of the copies pointed at the one that had lost its `else` for the
  reasoning. It is now a single `pruneTokensForBuild` that every path calls.

  Also stop `runtime.fs.glob` from mutating `config.exclude` in place. `exclude: []` — the shape the examples in this
  repository all use — had `'**/*.d.ts'` pushed onto the user's own array, so the second glob of a session saw a
  non-empty exclude list and behaved differently from the first.

- 6114f6e: Correct the `pruneUnusedTokens` documentation for `token()` returning a css variable.

  The JSDoc every editor shows on hover still described the old contract, and inverted the advice for exactly the
  failure the new one introduces: it said `token(key)` was "safe for any path, because javascript receives a literal",
  and pointed users at `token.var()` as the form needing `staticCss`. Both halves now return `var(--x)`, and the form
  that returns a literal is `token.value()`, which the text never mentioned.

  It also quantifies the bluntness rather than repeating the old figure: a project reaching for a token from javascript
  keeps 468 declarations on the default preset where the narrower exemption kept 68.

  `bamboo init`'s scaffold comment said `token.var()` with a computed path; it is `token()`. The token spec now offers
  `token.value()` unconditionally, since the `varRef` guard it inherited asked a question only the `token.var()` alias
  cared about.

### Patch Changes

- 5e8814c: Report `css(recipe.raw(props), …)`, which silently loses the recipe's styles.

  `.raw` on a **recipe or a pattern** takes props and returns styles. The build reads it as the identity that `css.raw`
  means — so it composes the _props_ instead:

  ```ts
  css(textInput.raw(), { fontFamily: 'monospace' })

  // the browser asks for : c_red.300  p_4  ff_monospace
  // the build emits      : —          —    ff_monospace
  ```

  The recipe's own declarations never reach the stylesheet, and for a call with variants the variant names are handed to
  the encoder as though they were properties. The element then renders without those styles, and nothing said so. It
  survives in practice only when some other component happens to emit the same atomic classes, so it breaks when an
  unrelated file stops using them.

  This does not resolve the composition — running the recipe during extraction to get it right is a larger change, and
  emitting the wrong styles would be worse than emitting none. **CSS output is unchanged.** What changes is that the
  build now says:

  ```
  textInput.raw() composes its own props rather than its styles, so textInput's declarations
  will not reach the stylesheet
    Call it instead — cx(textInput(props), css({ … })) — or move the overrides into textInput itself.
  ```

  Reported for inline recipes, config recipes and patterns alike. `css.raw()` composition is unaffected: identity is
  exactly what it means, and it reaches the stylesheet correctly.

### Minor Changes

- 41d9052: Add `prunePreflight`, which drops the parts of the reset that style elements your source never renders.

  Off by default. Measured on the example apps here:

  | app     |    raw |   gzip | brotli |
  | ------- | -----: | -----: | -----: |
  | vite-ts | -13.2% | -14.8% | -14.2% |
  | svelte  | -33.9% | -29.1% | -29.3% |

  Two thirds of the reset is bound to specific elements — 41 of them, covering `table`, `pre`, `kbd`, `optgroup` and the
  rest of the long tail. Being a fixed size, it dominates a small stylesheet rather than amortising the way the
  utilities layer does: a third of `vite-ts`'s css and four fifths of `svelte`'s, of which those projects render a
  fraction.

  This is the one saving of its kind that survives compression. Deduplicating or re-encoding what is already emitted
  loses to gzip, which has flattened the repetition before you get there — measured repeatedly on this codebase, from
  atomising recipes to native nesting. Emitting less does not.

  A selector list loses only the parts naming unrendered elements, so a rule shared between `button` and
  `::file-selector-button` keeps the half that still applies. `html` and `body` are never removed, and a selector naming
  no element — `*`, `::backdrop`, `[hidden]`, a class — is always kept.

  **Why it stays opt-in**

  `pruneUnusedTokens` and `pruneUnusedKeyframes` default to `true` because reachability can be established from the
  stylesheet and the source together. This has a textual scan of your own source and nothing else. An element rendered
  by a dependency's component, by `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, or by markdown is invisible to it, and what you get wrong
  is an element quietly losing its reset — no error, no warning. It cannot be made safe by default, and should not be.

  The blind spot to check first is nearer than a dependency. The scan reads what `include` covers, and `include`
  conventionally covers components rather than markup — `./src/**/*.tsx` does not match `index.html`, which is where
  `<noscript>`, a static `<table>` and the rest of a page's hand-written markup usually live. Add the template to
  `include` to cover it; the scan reads any file listed, not only ones the parser understands.

  **What the scan reads**

  The file on disk, not the project's parsed copy of it. That distinction only shows up for single-file components, and
  it decides whether they work at all: `parseSourceFile` replaces an SFC's text with the TSX a framework plugin
  transformed it into, and every transform here is lossy in the same direction. `svelteToTsx` and `vueToTsx` both
  swallow a throw and return an empty string, a Vue SFC with a render function and no `<template>` becomes the literal
  `<template>undefined</template>`, and Svelte strips `<script>` before the scan can see it. Each of those silently
  reports no elements for the file and takes every one of its reset rules with it. Markup is what this wants, so it
  reads the markup.

  It also works with a scoped reset. `preflight: { scope: '.app' }` writes the scope onto every selector — `.app table`,
  or `table.app` under `level: 'element'` — and neither shape names an element until the scope is stripped, so the two
  options together used to produce byte-identical output with the flag doing nothing at all.

  `bamboo cssgen preflight` prunes too. It writes one artifact rather than the whole sheet, so the token and keyframe
  passes cannot run there — both read the finished stylesheet to decide reachability, and on a partial one everything
  looks unreachable. This pass reads your source instead, so it is correct either way, and without it the `reset.css`
  from `cssgen preflight` disagreed with the one `cssgen --splitting` wrote for the same project.

- a1062c9: Remove `cssMode: 'grouped'`.

  **This is a breaking change released as a minor.** Bamboo is still pre-1.0 in practice, so the version does not carry
  the signal — read the migration below before upgrading. A config setting `cssMode` will fail to typecheck, and
  `bamboocss()` from `@bamboocss/vite` now returns an array of plugins rather than one.

  Use `cva({ base: { ... } })` where you want one class per element instead of one per property. It already does exactly
  that, and it does it better.

  **Why**

  Measured on a production build of a real app — the same source built both ways:

  |           |   CSS raw | CSS gzip |
  | --------- | --------: | -------: |
  | `atomic`  | 1,411,989 |  209,489 |
  | `grouped` | 2,913,254 |  390,428 |

  **+86% gzipped**, entirely in the `utilities` layer, which goes from 673 kB to 2.17 MB. Grouping pays only where a
  style set lands on many elements; it groups every `css()` call, and most of them are one-offs where a group is one
  rule serving one element with nothing to amortise it against.

  The markup saving cannot repay that. Across eight routes of the same app, grouping saved 1.9 bytes of gzipped markup
  per element rendered — so roughly **95,000 elements** have to render before the stylesheet's extra 181 kB is earned
  back, about 112 page views with a warm cache. The documentation claimed the trade favoured SSR and SSG; the app
  measured here is server-rendered and never comes close.

  **What to use instead**

  A variant-less `cva` emits a single class carrying every declaration:

  ```ts
  const row = cva({
    base: { display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', gap: '4' },
  })
  // .cva_gphwnw { display: flex; align-items: center; gap: var(--spacing-4) }
  ```

  It lands in the `recipes` layer rather than `utilities`, which is the part `cssMode` got wrong. Because
  `@layer reset, base, tokens, recipes, utilities` puts `utilities` last, a consumer's `css()` override beats it
  deterministically in every build — where a grouped `css()` class sat in `utilities` alongside the atoms it competed
  with, leaving conflicts to source order.

  The rule of thumb is the useful part: **if a style set is worth grouping, it is worth naming.** Grouping pays when a
  set is reused, and a reused set is a component.

  **Also removed**
  - `RuleProcessor.grouped()` and the `GroupedRule` type.
  - `groupClassName` from `@bamboocss/shared`, and the `grouped` / `knownGroups` fields on `CreateCssContext`.
  - The generated `groups` artifact (`styled-system/css/groups.mjs`) — delete it if a stale copy is left in your output
    directory.
  - The `'ambiguous-merge'` and `'too-many-combinations'` unresolved-style reasons, which only ever applied to grouping,
    and the `'grouped'` value of `UnresolvedStyle['kind']`.

  `css()` calls the build cannot fully read are still reported, unchanged: a spread or computed key warns with a file
  and line, because it looks static and is not.

- 43ae8a7: Stop keeping token declarations for `token()` when nothing calls it.

  Some declarations survive pruning purely so JavaScript can ask for them: virtual tokens, conditional ones, and the
  positive counterpart of every negative token. That last case is the expensive one — a negative is never declared
  itself, so it pins its positive and keeps the entire spacing scale alive whether or not anything uses it. The config
  documentation put that at "roughly a third of what survives pruning", and said there was no opt-out.

  There is now, and it needs no flag. The tokens artifact is generated into your project rather than installed, so the
  import is written in your own source and a scan of `include` finds it. When no file reaches for a token from
  JavaScript, the exemption has no caller to serve and is skipped.

  This changes emitted CSS by default, which is why it is a minor rather than the patch it started as.

  **What the scan looks for**

  A call — `token(`, `token.var(`, with whatever whitespace a formatter left around the dot — or a `from` / `import` /
  `require` of any module specifier carrying a `/tokens` path segment. Both tests over-match on purpose: keeping a
  declaration nothing reads costs bytes, and dropping one that is read returns a `var()` nothing declares.

  The import test is loose because the literal `styled-system/tokens` was too tight in three ways at once. `outdir` is
  configurable, so the artifact is only at `styled-system/` by default; a tsconfig path alias spells it something else
  again; and the artifact is a **directory**, so under NodeNext the only legal specifier is
  `styled-system/tokens/index.mjs` — which the literal did not match either. It is still anchored to an import keyword,
  because otherwise a URL or a route (`fetch('/api/tokens')`, an `href` of `/docs/theming/tokens`) reads as an import
  and switches the whole optimisation off without saying so.

  Measured on the sandboxes here:

  | app          |    raw |   gzip | brotli |
  | ------------ | -----: | -----: | -----: |
  | svelte       | -20.2% | -12.9% | -12.2% |
  | gatsby-ts    | -19.0% | -11.8% | -11.3% |
  | next-js-app  | -18.6% | -11.7% | -10.8% |
  | vite-ts      |  -6.9% |  -4.9% |  -4.1% |
  | runtime-perf |  -2.0% |  -1.9% |  -1.9% |
  | preact-ts    |     0% |     0% |     0% |

  `preact-ts` is the control, and it is the shape you want to check yourself against: it calls `token()`, so the
  exemption has a caller, nothing is skipped, and its stylesheet is byte-for-byte what it was. Every other app here
  reaches for no token from JavaScript, and the spread between them is how much of their theme the CSS alone could not
  account for.

  Across all sixteen example apps: 0% wherever a project reaches for a token, and -2.0% to -20.2% raw wherever none
  does, most of them between -11% and -19%.

  A project that calls `token()`, `token.var()`, or imports the tokens artifact anywhere under `include` is unaffected —
  and a hand-written `var(--x)` in source was already covered by the existing reference scan.

  Two shapes the scan does not see, both rare and neither loud. `include` scopes style extraction rather than everything
  that may import, so a build script, a config file, or a sibling workspace package calling `token()` is not covered;
  nor is a binding renamed away from `token`, as in `const t = token`. In both the declaration is pruned and the call
  returns a `var()` nothing declares. `pruneUnusedTokens: false` keeps every declaration if you are in that position.

- 0e6a4ee: `@bamboocss/vite` now emits the stylesheet itself, so a Vite project needs no PostCSS setup.

  Import the virtual module wherever you used to import the file carrying the `@layer` statement:

  ```ts
  // vite.config.ts
  import bamboocss from '@bamboocss/vite'

  export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [bamboocss(), react()],
  })
  ```

  ```ts
  // src/main.tsx
  import 'virtual:bamboo.css'
  ```

  ```ts
  // src/vite-env.d.ts
  /// <reference types="@bamboocss/vite/client" />
  ```

  `bamboocss()` now returns **two** plugins rather than one: the CSS emitter, which runs in dev and build alike, and the
  build-only fold. If you were reaching into the returned object — `bamboocss().transform`, say — it is now an array.

  **Why a virtual module rather than a written file**

  Vite already owns both things a file would have to reimplement. In dev it injects CSS over the websocket and replaces
  it in place, so a style edit repaints without reloading and without losing component state. In build it hashes the
  content into the asset graph and decides where it lands. Writing `styles.css` and asking the project to import it
  means the build reads a file the same process just wrote, which is a race on every watch rebuild.

  The stylesheet carries its own `@layer reset, base, tokens, recipes, utilities;` statement, which the PostCSS path
  takes from the file it injects into. That statement is what fixes layer _order_ — without it, layers are ordered by
  first appearance.

  **PostCSS still works.** This is an addition, not a replacement; nothing about the existing setup changes. Use one or
  the other, though — configuring both puts two copies of the sheet in the bundle.

  Also adds `Builder.toCss()` for anything that wants the finished stylesheet as a string rather than injected into a
  PostCSS root.

## 1.20.2

### Patch Changes

- 8a73d2a: Stop the PostCSS plugin injecting a second copy of the stylesheet into a file that already imports it.

  `isValidRoot` reads only the `@layer` statement, and that statement is ordinary CSS — listing every layer in order is
  what a project has to write once it has layers of its own beside Bamboo's. So this file satisfies the guard while
  already holding the sheet:

  ```css
  @import '#app/styled-system/styles.css'; /* copy 1 — inlined by postcss-import first */
  @layer reset, base, tokens, recipes, utilities, overrides, syntaxHighlighter; /* triggers copy 2 */
  ```

  Vite puts `postcss-import` at the front of the chain, so the `cssgen` artifact is inlined before any plugin runs.
  `isValidLayerParams` then sees all five Bamboo layers among the seven names, returns true, and `write` appends a
  freshly generated copy. The config is correct; the guard was wrong.

  `write` now checks for the `--made-with-bamboo` declaration that `generateGlobalCss` emits unconditionally, and skips
  with a warning when generated CSS is already present. A declaration rather than a comment, because the copy already in
  the root may have been minified before this runs and comments do not survive that — which also makes it a better
  signal than the markers added in 1.20.1, so those are gone again.

  **Why it went unnoticed**

  The duplication does not look like duplication by the time it ships. A minifier merges the two `@layer X{}` blocks and
  dedupes most of the collision; what survives is what it cannot merge — rules nested inside `@media`, `@supports` or
  `@scope`, where each copy contributes its own sub-block, plus top-level pseudo-element rules split out of selector
  lists. On one production stylesheet that residue was 402 rules and 21 kB: 11% of the file, reading as a rounding error
  rather than as the whole sheet twice.

  If you have both an `@import` of `styles.css` and the `@layer` statement, keep one. The warning now says which.

## 1.20.1

### Patch Changes

- 559924f: Stop the PostCSS plugin appending a second copy of the stylesheet when a root reaches it twice.

  `Builder.write` appended the generated css to the user's root, and what it appended carries the
  `@layer reset, base, tokens, recipes, utilities;` declaration that `isValidRoot` looks for. So the guard deciding
  whether to inject was satisfied by the result of injecting, and nothing removed or replaced a previous injection. A
  root that reached `write` twice — a plugin registered in both `postcss.config.js` and the bundler config, or a chain
  that re-processes emitted css — accumulated a whole copy each time: 101 rules became 201, 22.8 kB became 45.5 kB.

  Nothing downstream took those apart. Each copy is internally consistent and only duplicated against the other, so
  `postcss-discard-duplicates` never sees a duplicate within the sheet it is given. That is how a production stylesheet
  came to carry 402 byte-identical rules in identical contexts — 21 kB, 11% of the file — concentrated entirely in
  Bamboo's own layers while the app's own layers were clean.

  The injection is now bracketed by `/* bamboocss:start */` and `/* bamboocss:end */`, and `write` removes a previous
  block before appending. Comments rather than a flag on the node, because the root can be stringified and re-parsed
  between two plugins in the same chain and nothing on the node survives that round trip.

  Removal is bounded by the end marker rather than running to the end of the root, so anything a later plugin appended
  after the injection stays where it is. A start marker with no end — what an uneven comment strip would leave — removes
  nothing, which is the safe direction: a duplicate costs bytes, dropping a user's css does not fail loudly.

  If you were hitting this, the duplicates are worth looking for: they survive minification, since each copy is valid
  css.

## 1.20.0

### Minor Changes

- 5d2c91c: Prune unreachable tokens, keyframes and `@property` rules by default.

  `pruneUnusedTokens` and `pruneUnusedKeyframes` both default to `true` now. On the example apps in this repository:

  | app          |             raw |          gzip |
  | ------------ | --------------: | ------------: |
  | svelte       |  22,047 → 5,188 | 5,442 → 1,802 |
  | runtime-perf |   9,107 → 3,462 |   1,941 → 989 |
  | vite-ts      | 13,845 → 10,463 | 3,390 → 3,053 |

  That is 10–67% of the gzipped, render-blocking stylesheet, and it scales with the size of the design system rather
  than the size of the app — so the larger the theme, the more of it was being shipped for nothing. `bamboo init`
  already turned both on, so newly scaffolded projects had this and everyone else did not.

  Set either to `false` to restore the previous behaviour.

  **`@property` registrations no longer depend on the flag**

  A preset registers every custom property its utilities compose — filters, gradients, transforms, transitions — from
  the config rather than from what the app draws. That is 42 rules and 3.2 kB, byte-identical in every project here, of
  which **41 to 42 were referenced by nothing at all**.

  Those are now dropped whether or not `pruneUnusedTokens` is set. The flag exists because a token can be reached by a
  name the pass never sees — `token.var()` with a path assembled at runtime, a stylesheet outside `include`, a package
  consuming the output as design tokens. A registration has no such surface: nothing hands one to JavaScript and none
  are part of the `token()` api, verified as zero overlap with declared tokens. Whether the finished stylesheet mentions
  one is the whole question, so opting out of the half that cannot be proven should not mean carrying the half that can.

  Turning `pruneUnusedTokens` off is still exact for token declarations — every one is kept.

  **Upgrading**

  The three cases the reachability pass cannot see are unchanged and are the ones to check if a value goes missing:
  - a token named by a path the source does not spell out as a string literal, such as `token.var(key)`
  - a token referenced only from a stylesheet outside `include`
  - a token consumed by a separate package treating the output as design tokens

  List those under `staticCss`, or set `pruneUnusedTokens: false`. The equivalent for an animation name assembled at
  runtime is already covered — the keyframe pass falls back to a deliberately over-inclusive textual scan of `include`.

### Patch Changes

- 6512d6b: Update the PostCSS toolchain, and fold shared selector prefixes into `:is()` when minifying.

  | package                            |   from |     to |
  | ---------------------------------- | -----: | -----: |
  | `postcss`                          | 8.5.25 | 8.5.26 |
  | `postcss-selector-parser`          |  7.1.1 |  7.1.5 |
  | `postcss-discard-duplicates`       |  7.0.2 |  8.0.2 |
  | `postcss-discard-empty`            |  7.0.1 |  8.0.2 |
  | `postcss-minify-selectors`         |  7.0.5 |  8.0.3 |
  | `postcss-nested`                   |  7.0.2 |  8.0.1 |
  | `postcss-normalize-whitespace`     |  7.0.1 |  8.0.2 |
  | `@csstools/postcss-cascade-layers` |  5.0.2 |  6.0.0 |
  | `browserslist`                     | 4.28.1 | 4.28.7 |

  The cssnano majors raise their engine floor to `^22.11.0 || ^24.11.0 || >=26.0`. Nothing here declares `engines`, so
  it is not enforced at install time, but a build on Node 24.10 or older 24.x runs these plugins outside their supported
  range.

  **Minified `globalCss` changes**

  `postcss-minify-selectors` 8 adds `convertToIs`, which factors a shared prefix or suffix in a selector list into
  `:is(...)` where that shortens it. It is on, and it reaches `globalCss` — a selector list nested under a parent is the
  common case:

  ```diff
    '.card': { '& h1, & h2': { fontWeight: 'bold' } }

  - .card h1,.card h2 { font-weight: … }
  + .card :is(h1,h2) { font-weight: … }
  ```

  Class names and hashes are unchanged, `:is()` takes the highest specificity of its arguments so the folded rule
  matches and ranks exactly as the list did, and unminified output is untouched.

  Atomic and recipe output is unaffected, and not incidentally: each atomic class carries a unique declaration, so
  `merge-rules` never combines two into a list with shared structure, and a scoped slot variant is a plain selector
  inside an `@scope` block rather than a list. Measured over every stylesheet this repo generates — 59 selector lists,
  none foldable, zero bytes moved. The fold is worth having for authored CSS; it is not a size win on generated CSS, and
  nothing here should be read as claiming one.

  **The browser baseline is now fixed, and `@scope` sets it**

  Upstream gates the fold on `caniuse-api`, and resolves the target it asks about from `process.cwd()` — the consuming
  project, not `config.browserslist`. Two things follow, and both break the guarantee that a given input compiles to one
  stylesheet: output would depend on where the build ran, and it would flip on its own as `caniuse-lite` refreshed. So
  the baseline is passed explicitly and no longer consults the ambient config.

  Documenting that baseline turned up errors in it. `@scope` was described as a raised floor that only projects with
  `root`-slot recipes reach, with a lower general baseline beneath it — which made the supported set depend on how a
  project's recipes happen to be written. `@scope` is the documented baseline now, one floor, and `scopeRoots: []` is no
  longer offered as a way under it: it controls scoping, not what Bamboo supports.

  The numbers behind it were wrong in two places. Firefox is **146**, not 128 — caniuse records 128 through 145 as no
  support, not partial — and Opera is **106**, not 104. Anyone on Firefox 128–145 had been told slot recipes would work.
  The retired lower tier had its own version of this: it claimed `:is()` as a baseline feature while listing
  `Opera >= 73`, which predates it by two majors.

  **Coverage**

  The minified branch had no tests, which is how a plugin swapping "sort and dedupe a selector list" for "fold it into
  `:is()`" changed emitted CSS without a snapshot moving. `packages/core/__tests__/optimize-minify.test.ts` now locks
  the minified output, and asserts it is unchanged under a hostile ambient `BROWSERSLIST`.

- 0441724: Update the runtime dependencies that decide how the framework behaves. Emitted CSS is unchanged — Lightning
  CSS 1.33 produces the sandbox stylesheet byte for byte as 1.31 did.

  | package              |   from |     to | reaches                   |
  | -------------------- | -----: | -----: | ------------------------- |
  | `lightningcss`       | 1.31.1 | 1.33.0 | CSS output when enabled   |
  | `ts-evaluator`       |  1.2.0 |  2.0.0 | expression evaluation     |
  | `chokidar`           |  4.0.3 |  5.0.0 | watch mode                |
  | `@vue/compiler-sfc`  | 3.5.25 | 3.5.41 | Vue SFC extraction        |
  | `@vue/compiler-core` | 3.5.25 | 3.5.41 | the types the above emits |
  | `picomatch`          |  4.0.4 |  4.0.5 | file matching             |

  `@vue/compiler-core` is a dev-only type import in `plugin-vue`, and it was pinned a version behind `compiler-sfc`.
  That had been invisible while both were 3.5.25; moving only `compiler-sfc` put two copies of the AST types in the tree
  and `BaseElementNode` stopped matching the nodes `parse` actually returns. Both move together from here.

  **Three were deliberately left alone**

  `magic-string` stays at 0.30.21. 1.x is ESM-only — `"type": "module"`, no `require` export — and `@bamboocss/vite`,
  `plugin-vue` and `plugin-svelte` all ship a CJS build that emits `require("magic-string")`. It resolves today and
  would not on 1.x, breaking every CJS consumer. Nothing in the suite would notice, since the tests run ESM.

  `open-props` stays at 1.7.16. 1.7.23 hardcodes the shadow scale:

  ```diff
  - --shadow-1: 0 1px 2px -1px hsl(var(--shadow-color) / calc(var(--shadow-strength) + 9%))
  + --shadow-1: 0 1px 2px -1px hsl(220 3% 15% / 10%)
  ```

  The `--shadow-color` and `--shadow-strength` indirection is gone, and with it `--shadow-color-@media:dark` and
  `--inner-shadow-highlight`. `preset-open-props` reads these values straight out of `open-props/src`, so taking the
  bump means shadows stop responding to dark mode. Upstream moved that into separate light and dark files; adopting it
  is a port, not a version bump.

  `typescript` stays at 6.0.2, which is what `@ts-morph/common@0.29.0` bundles. ts-morph 28 is current, so TypeScript 7
  would put the compiler the parser runs on out of step with the one the repo type-checks against.

### Minor Changes

- 070f9da: Keep the token a custom property outside the token layer points at, and scaffold pruning into new projects.

  `pruneUnusedTokens` decided reachability by following references found in the stylesheet. A custom property the token
  system did not declare is never removed — it is not pruning's to remove — but it was only treated as reachable if
  something else in the sheet referenced it. Exporting a value is precisely the case where nothing does:

  ```ts
  globalCss: {
    ':root': { '--brand': '{colors.blue.500}' },
  }
  ```

  `--brand` survived; `--colors-blue-500` did not. The result was a `var()` with no declaration behind it, which
  resolves to the guaranteed-invalid value — so a colour falls back to _inherited_ rather than to nothing. Silently
  wrong rather than visibly missing, and invisible in a css diff unless you were looking for it.

  Any custom property pruning will not remove is now a root of the reachability walk, so what it references is kept with
  it. Costs nothing: measured byte-identical output across the website and every sandbox, none of which declares one.

  `bamboo init` now scaffolds `pruneUnusedTokens` and `pruneUnusedKeyframes` as `true`, with a note on when to turn them
  off. They stay `false` by default, so no existing project changes. A new project gets 50-60% off its stylesheet on day
  one, when it has no styles yet and anything unexpected is immediately visible — measured 5,304 -> 2,213 bytes gzipped
  on a stock Next.js app, 5,566 -> 2,601 on Remix, and 15,619 -> 13,017 on this repo's own docs site.

  The config docs also now say which `token()` form actually needs `staticCss`: `token(key)` is safe for any path,
  because javascript receives a literal for a plain token. It is `token.var(key)` that hands back a reference and needs
  the declaration to survive.

## 1.17.0

### Minor Changes

- 049a382: Report a `css()` call the build could not fully read under `cssMode: 'atomic'`, not only under `grouped`.

  ```jsx
  css({ ...getFocusRingStyles(), color: 'red' })
  // `.c_red` is emitted; the focus ring's declarations are not, and nothing said so
  ```

  The detection was gated on `grouped` because that is where a loss is _fatal_ — one class names the whole call, so
  missing part of it costs all of it. Under `atomic` the loss is partial: what the build saw still applies. But it is no
  less silent, and a component quietly missing its focus ring is exactly the shape that gets reported as a mystery
  rather than as a bug.

  Only the surprising half is reported. A spread the build could not read **looks** static and is not, so it interrupts.
  A value it could not evaluate — `css({ color: getColor() })` — is the documented dynamic-styling shape, answered by
  `staticCss` and already covered by the `no-dynamic-styling` lint rule; warning on every one of those would bury the
  first. Grouped mode keeps reporting both, because there either kind costs the whole call.

  The message is written for the mode it fires in rather than reusing grouped's, which ended "to group it".

- 7251bf8: Report a recipe config the build could not fully read, instead of emitting a stylesheet nothing will ask for.

  A `cva`/`sva` config with a spread the extractor cannot resolve loses those declarations — and since 1.16 that is not
  a partial loss. A recipe's classes are named from a hash of its config, so a dropped declaration changes the hash: the
  build emits rules under one name and the browser asks for another, and the element renders with **no styles at all**.

  ```jsx
  cva({ base: { ...getFocusRing(), color: 'red' } })
  // build emits  .cva_iPlRDu, .cva_iPlRDu--size_sm
  // browser asks cva_gLgUZR…      — nothing matches
  ```

  Before 1.16 atomic class names were content-addressed per declaration, so the spread's properties were missing but
  everything the build _did_ resolve still applied. Semantic recipe naming turned that benign limit into total loss.

  The detection already existed — `findUnresolvedStyles`, added for `cssMode: 'grouped'`, where one class names a whole
  `css()` call. That gate was right for what it was written for and was never extended when recipes gained the same
  property, in every mode. Recipes are now checked regardless of `cssMode`, and the message says what to do:

  ```
  🎋 warn [recipe] app/Button.tsx:4:18 — an object spread or computed key leaves the build unable to tell
  which properties this call sets. A recipe's classes are named from a hash of its config, so a declaration
  the build cannot see gives the build and the browser different names and the element renders with no
  styles at all. Set `className` on the recipe, so its name does not depend on what the build could resolve.
  ```

  `className` is the fix as well as the workaround: the identity short-circuits on it and never hashes the styles, so
  extraction fidelity stops deciding the name and the loss degrades to the missing declarations alone. A recipe that
  sets one is not reported.

  Reported per level with its path — `base`, `variants.size.sm`, `compoundVariants.0.css`, `base.root` for a slot. Three
  ways a level can lose something are covered:
  - a **spread or computed key** that contributed no keys beyond those written beside it;
  - a **value the build could not evaluate** (`{ color: getColor() }`), which leaves no trace in the box tree at all
    because the pair is never recorded — this one needs the written source compared against the resolved data;
  - the config **not being an object literal**, as in `cva(someConfig)`, which is the quietest total loss of the lot.

  Every level is unwrapped first, so `as const` and `satisfies` — idiomatic on a recipe config — do not hide the loss. A
  spread of a literal is not reported, since its keys are written right there and nothing can have gone missing.

  **Cost.** The check walks the config, so it roughly doubles the walking a recipe already costs: on a file of eight
  variant-heavy recipes, parse goes from 1.087 ms to 1.390 ms (+28%). It is skipped entirely for a recipe that sets
  `className` — so the state this warning asks for is also the one that does not pay for it. Folding the comparison into
  extraction, rather than walking a second time, is the way to remove the cost outright.

  This does not change what CSS is emitted. `css()` in atomic mode still drops an unresolvable spread silently; that is
  unchanged and pre-existing.

### Patch Changes

- 29f9bbe: Fix conditional token values being silently dropped on postcss `>= 8.5.25`.

  A semantic token declared with a conditional value emitted only its `base` half — no error, no warning — so a themed
  app kept its light values in dark mode:

  ```ts
  semanticTokens: {
    colors: {
      panel: { value: { base: '#ffffff', _osDark: '#131211' } },
    },
  }
  ```

  ```css
  /* before — the `_osDark` half never reached the tokens layer */
  @layer tokens {
    :where(:root, :host) {
      --colors-panel: #ffffff;
    }
  }
  ```

  `getDeepestRule` seeded its nesting chain with an empty-selector rule and relied on postcss-nested erasing `&` against
  it. postcss 8.5.25 ("Fixed 8.5.17 visitor regression") changed that edge case to collapse the whole selector, so every
  conditional token was emitted as a selectorless — and therefore discarded — rule. The chain is now built on a `Root`,
  and the top-level `&` is resolved directly instead of through postcss-nested.

## 1.16.0

### Minor Changes

- f2d5df2: **Breaking:** remove the JSX factory. Bamboo no longer generates components, and is now framework-agnostic.

  `styled-system/jsx` is not emitted at all. `styled` / `bamboo`, style props, the `css` prop, `as`, `unstyled`,
  `createStyleContext`, `splitCssProps` and `isCssProperty` are gone, along with `jsxFramework`, `jsxFactory` and
  `jsxStyleProps`. There is no React, Vue, Solid, Preact or Qwik codegen left anywhere.

  ```tsx
  // before
  <styled.div color="red.300" padding="4">hi</styled.div>
  const Button = styled('button', buttonRecipe)

  // after
  <div className={css({ color: 'red.300', padding: '4' })}>hi</div>
  const Button = (props: ButtonProps) => {
    const [variantProps, rest] = buttonRecipe.splitVariantProps(props)
    return <button {...rest} className={cx(buttonRecipe(variantProps), props.className)} />
  }
  ```

  For an override to be deterministic the component's styles have to sit in a lower cascade layer, which means declaring
  them as a config recipe — an inline `cva()` is atomic and lands in `utilities` alongside the consumer. A component
  that instead accepts a style object and merges it with `css(base, props.css)` needs no layer at all.

  **Recipe JSX tracking is kept**, and no longer depends on `jsxFramework`. A recipe's `jsx: ['Button']` hint is how the
  build reads `<Button variant="danger">` on a component you wrote and emits `--variant_danger`; without it those
  variants would silently stop being generated. It costs no codegen — it is extraction only.

  **`createStyleContext` has no replacement in the box.** Compound components that need one slot to see the variant
  chosen at the root now write their own context; `docs/concepts/slot-recipes` documents the ~20-line version.

  What this removes beyond the API: the whole per-framework generator tree, `is-valid-prop` (a large module that shipped
  to the browser only to decide whether a prop was a style prop), `normalize-html`, the vite fold's JSX element path —
  which has nothing left to fold — and the per-framework test matrix.

  `@bamboocss/plugin-vue` and `@bamboocss/plugin-svelte` are unaffected: they transform source so the extractor can read
  it, which has nothing to do with the factory.

- 1dbeb84: **Breaking:** remove JSX pattern components.

  `styled-system/jsx` no longer emits a component per pattern — `<Stack>`, `<Box>`, `<HStack>` and the rest are gone,
  and `styled-system/jsx` now exports only the factory, `isCssProperty` and `createStyleContext`.

  Pattern **functions** are unchanged. Every pattern still ships from `styled-system/patterns`, and a pattern function
  passes arbitrary style props through, so the rewrite is mechanical and behaviour-preserving:

  ```tsx
  // before
  <Stack gap="4" mt="8">{children}</Stack>
  <Box p="4">{children}</Box>

  // after
  <div className={stack({ gap: '4', mt: '8' })}>{children}</div>
  <div className={css({ p: '4' })}>{children}</div>
  ```

  The `jsx`, `jsxName` and `jsxElement` fields on a pattern config are removed along with them — they only ever
  described a component bamboo generated. `jsx` on a **recipe** is untouched.

  Everything that existed to serve the component layer goes with it: the five per-framework pattern generators, the
  `jsx-patterns` artifact, the parser's `jsx-pattern` result type and `JsxEngine`'s pattern matcher, and the vite fold's
  pattern-element path. `Patterns.find`/`Patterns.filter` (both keyed by JSX name) are gone, and
  `StyleEncoder.processPattern` takes `(name, props, grouped)`.

  Two consequences worth knowing:
  - A component of your own named `Box` or `Stack` is no longer misread as bamboo's pattern. It extracts as an ordinary
    component, which is what it always was.
  - The `jsx-patterns-index` artifact is now `jsx-index`, since it no longer indexes patterns.

- d7226f0: **Breaking:** remove template literal syntax.

  The `syntax` config option is gone, along with the `--syntax` CLI flag and the syntax question `bamboo init -i` asked.
  Styles are written as objects.

  A project that set `syntax: 'template-literal'` now gets a TypeScript error on the option, and its tagged templates
  are no longer read by the extractor — `` css`color: red;` `` and `` styled.div`color: red;` `` produce no CSS. Convert
  them to object literals:

  ```tsx
  // before
  const One = styled.div`
    display: flex;
    width: 300px;
  `

  // after
  const One = styled('div', {
    base: {
      display: 'flex',
      width: '300px',
    },
  })
  ```

  Everything the option gated goes with it: the string-literal `css`/`conditions` runtimes and the string-literal JSX
  factories and types for all five frameworks, the parser's tagged-template branch, the extractor's `taggedTemplates`
  matcher, the vite fold's tagged-template path, and `astish` from `@bamboocss/shared`. Under the object syntax `cva`,
  `sva`, patterns, `is-valid-prop`, style props and `viewTransition()` were already the only paths taken, so their
  generated output is unchanged — the codegen artifacts are byte-identical.

### Patch Changes

- bb6d999: Stop `cssMode: 'grouped'` rendering elements with no styles at all, in the shapes that were left.

  A grouped class names a whole `css()` call, so the build has to have encoded that exact call to emit its rule. The
  runtime already falls back to atomic class names when it has not — but a fallback only helps if atomic rules for those
  names exist, and the build emitted them for a `css()` call it knew it had lost and nowhere else. Every other way of
  losing a call landed on nothing, and the element rendered unstyled with no warning:
  - A conditional value beside any other prop on a JSX element or in a pattern —
    `<styled.div color={on ? 'red' : 'blue'} padding="2" />`. Only `css()` reconstructs a ternary's branches; a JSX
    element or a pattern encoded each extracted object on its own, and the runtime asked for the merge of them.
  - A value the build could not evaluate beside another prop on either —
    `<styled.div color={props.tone} padding="2" />`.
  - A property lost to a spread — `css({ ...props.styles, color: 'red' })`.
  - Two arguments setting one property, which the build read as a pair of ternary branches rather than as a merge —
    `css({ color: { base: 'red' } }, { color: { _hover: 'blue' } })`.

  Those now emit their atomic rules alongside their group, so the element keeps every declaration the build resolved —
  the same styling `cssMode: 'atomic'` gives for the same source. The `css()` cases warn, with a file, a line, and what
  to change; a conditional style prop is ordinary code and does not.

  Two shapes group properly now instead of degrading:
  - A ternary inside a condition block, beside another property —
    `css({ _hover: { color: on ? 'red' : 'blue' }, padding: '2' })`. Reconstructing the branches combined them with
    `Object.assign`, so the empty `_hover` carried by the entry holding `padding` replaced the branch's condition
    instead of merging into it. They are merged the way `mergeCss` merges now.
  - An array argument — `css([{ color: 'red' }, { padding: '2' }])`.

  A call site that emits atomic rules alongside its group costs some CSS. It is bounded by how many call sites the build
  cannot fully see, and buys back the styles they were dropping.

- 4877a67: Correct the `cssMode: 'grouped'` unresolved-value warning, which described the behaviour it had before the
  atomic fallback landed.

  It said the element "renders with no styles at all". It no longer does — the call falls back to naming each
  declaration separately and keeps the ones the build could resolve. The warning now says that, and says what to do
  about it.

- 645bb09: Stop `cssMode: 'grouped'` rendering an element with no styles when the build could not see the whole `css()`
  call.

  A grouped class names a whole call, so the build has to have seen that exact call to emit its rule. When it had not —
  an unresolvable value, a combination it declined to enumerate — the runtime returned a class with nothing behind it
  and the element rendered blank. Not a degraded version of the styles: none of them.

  Three pieces, and the feature needs all three:
  - The build writes the set of grouped classes it emitted to `styled-system/css/groups.mjs`, refreshed after every
    extraction — including `--watch`, which reaches CSS emission through a path of its own. `codegen` seeds an empty one
    when the file is missing, so the import resolves on a fresh project, and leaves a populated one alone rather than
    blanking it.
  - The generated `css()` consults it. A class in the set is returned alone, as before. A class that is not keeps the
    group class and **adds** atomic names for each declaration.
  - A call the build flagged as unresolvable now contributes atomic rules as well as its group, so those names have
    somewhere to land. Gated on the call actually being at risk, so the duplication is bounded by unresolvable call
    sites rather than by stylesheet size.

  Adding to the group class rather than replacing it is what makes a stale registry harmless: it lags the stylesheet as
  a matter of when files land, and replacing would turn every lag into an element stripped of styles it really had. A
  wrong miss now costs one class that matches nothing. Only a false _hit_ can hurt, which is why the registry is an
  exact set and not a probabilistic one.

  A value the build never saw still has no rule under any mode — the same limit `atomic` has. What changes is that the
  declarations it _did_ resolve now apply.

- 645bb09: Warn, with a file and line, when a `css()` call under `cssMode: 'grouped'` contains a value the build cannot
  resolve.

  Under `grouped` one class names the whole call, so a property the build cannot see does not merely go missing — it
  changes the class, and the element renders with **no** styles at all. Until now that happened silently: the build
  emitted a rule, the runtime returned a different class, and nothing said so.

  Two shapes are detected, because one of them leaves no trace in the extracted styles:
  - a value boxed as unresolvable, or a template literal with an interpolation
  - a property whose value could not be evaluated at all — `css({ color: getColor() })`. The extractor records no pair
    for it, so the key vanishes from the box entirely; it is recovered by reading the call's object literal back and
    comparing.

  Shapes that cannot be read confidently — a spread, a computed key, a multi-argument call — are declined rather than
  guessed at, so the warning does not fire on styles that are fine.

  A warning, not an error: the build is not wrong and the same call is perfectly valid under `cssMode: 'atomic'`, which
  loses one declaration and keeps the rest. Nothing is reported under `atomic` for that reason.

- 645bb09: Fail the build when the stylesheet and the runtime would disagree on class names.

  A class name is derived twice — once by `StyleDecoder` on the way into the stylesheet, and once by `css()` in the
  browser — and the two only ever meet in the DOM. When they disagree there is no error and no warning: the rule is
  emitted, the class is returned, and every element carrying it renders with no styles at all. That is how
  `cssMode: 'grouped'` combined with `hash: true` shipped broken.

  `checkNamingAgreement` now runs once per build, against the config actually being built. It sends a canary style
  object through both paths and compares the class names, raising `ERR_BAMBOO_NAMING_DISAGREEMENT` with both sets when
  they differ.

  Running it against the real config matters because the naming inputs are open-ended: the `utility:created` hook can
  replace `toHash` outright, and `separator`, `prefix` and custom utilities all feed the same derivation. A test can
  only pin the combinations it enumerates.

  The check runs on cloned encoder and decoder, so the canary never reaches the stylesheet being emitted.

- 645bb09: Warn when `staticCss.css` is configured alongside `cssMode: 'grouped'`.

  `staticCss` is documented as the escape hatch for values the build cannot see — pre-generate `color: ['red.300']` and
  a runtime `color` prop holding `red.300` finds a rule waiting. That does not hold under `grouped`, and cannot be made
  to: `staticCss` enumerates atoms, one rule per property, value and condition, while a grouped class names a whole
  `css()` call. Backing an arbitrary call site would mean pre-generating every combination of properties it might
  contain rather than every value it might hold.

  The rules are still emitted and are still valid classes to write by hand, so nothing is removed. But no class a
  grouped runtime returns will match one, and the pairing previously produced CSS that looked like a working escape
  hatch and silently was not.

  Documented in the `cssMode` limitations and in the dynamic styling guide.

### Minor Changes

- b567114: Drop `@bamboocss/studio` and `@bamboocss/astro-plugin-studio`.

  Studio was the visual token browser inherited from Panda — an Astro site that read your config and rendered your
  colors, typography and spacing. It is no longer maintained, and both packages are removed from the repository. The
  versions already on npm stay there and keep working; they will not receive further releases.

  **`bamboo studio` is gone.** Its own flags — `--build`, `--preview`, `--port`, `--host`, `--outdir` and `--base` —
  have no replacement. If you have it in a `package.json` script, remove the script.

  **`config.studio` is gone**, along with the `StudioOptions` type. Leaving `studio: { logo, outdir, inject }` in a
  config is now a TypeScript error rather than a silent no-op, so delete it — a plain-JS config will keep ignoring it.
  `Context.studio` is removed from `@bamboocss/core`, and the `MISSING_STUDIO` error code from `@bamboocss/shared`'s
  `BambooErrorCode` union.

  The studio output directory is no longer written to `.gitignore` by `bamboo init`. Existing `.gitignore` files keep
  their `styled-system-studio` line until you remove it, which is harmless — nothing writes there anymore.

  For documenting a design system, [spec files](/docs/theming/spec) generate a machine-readable description of your
  tokens, recipes and patterns that you can render however you like, and the [MCP server](/docs/ai/mcp-server) exposes
  the same information to AI tooling.

### Minor Changes

- a07286f: Add `pruneUnusedKeyframes`, dropping `@keyframes` rules nothing can reach.

  A preset declares every animation it offers and an app uses a handful. The rest sit in the one stylesheet that blocks
  first paint. On the fixture preset this drops all four unused keyframes and 436 bytes; it scales with the size of the
  design system rather than the app, the same way `pruneUnusedTokens` does.

  It is **off by default** and changes nothing until switched on.

  Only keyframes the theme declares are ever removed, so one emitted by `globalCss` is left alone. A name is kept when
  an animation property in the generated css names it, when it appears anywhere under `include`, or when it is named in
  a custom property that is itself reachable.

  That last clause is what makes the pass worth having. `preset-bamboo` declares
  `--animations-spin: spin 1s linear infinite` whether or not anything uses that token, so counting every custom
  property as a reference would keep every keyframe the preset ships. References from a custom property are held back
  and only credited once the property is reached through `var()`, following the chain — the same reachability model
  `pruneTokenVars` uses.

  Names are recovered by tokenizing values and testing each token against the declared set, rather than by parsing the
  `animation` shorthand, which interleaves durations, easings and directions in any order. A keyframe named after a
  keyword therefore always looks referenced. That is the intended bias: keeping an unused keyframe costs bytes, dropping
  a used one silently stops an animation.

  The textual scan over `include` covers what the css cannot show — an animation name assembled at runtime, or applied
  through an inline `style` rather than through bamboo.

- a5cb5a8: Add `pruneUnusedTokens`, dropping token css variables nothing can reach.

  The token layer declares every token in the theme. An app uses a fraction of them, so most of what it declares is dead
  weight in the one stylesheet that blocks first paint. On the `vite-ts` sandbox, with the default preset, this takes
  `styles.css` from 24,433 to 12,293 bytes — 6,398 to 3,504 gzipped. It scales with the size of the design system rather
  than the app: `preset-bamboo` declares 432 variables, `preset-atlaskit` 837, `preset-open-props` 898.

  It is **off by default** and changes nothing until switched on.

  A variable is kept when the generated css references it, when a kept variable's own value references it, or when it is
  named by `token()` or `token.var()` or a literal `var(--x)` anywhere under `include`. Tokens that javascript receives
  as a reference rather than a literal are always kept, because `token('colors.text')` hands the caller a `var()`
  whether or not the css mentions it. That covers virtual tokens, any token carrying a condition, and negative tokens —
  `spacing.-4` resolves to `calc(var(--spacing-4) * -1)`, so what has to survive is the _positive_ token's declaration,
  not its own. So is anything a theme refers to: a theme is a separate artifact injected at runtime, so nothing in the
  sheet points at what it needs.

  The negative-token rule is the one with a visible price, and there is no opt-out. A spacing scale generates one
  negative per entry, so the whole scale is pinned whether or not the app uses it: on the default preset an app
  referencing a single colour keeps 37 spacing variables, about a third of everything that survives. Presets with large
  spacing scales therefore see less than the numbers above.

  The walk follows any custom property, not only the removable ones. A colour palette is what forces that:
  `colorPalette: 'red'` emits `--colors-color-palette-300: var(--colors-red-300)`, and those palette properties are
  virtual, so stopping at them would leave the rule pointing at colours that had been removed.

  Two limits are deliberate:
  - Only custom properties the token system declares are eligible. `globalCss` output is never touched. `preset-base`
    declares the filter and gradient composition properties on the universal selector precisely so a parent's value
    cannot inherit into a descendant; they look unreferenced, and removing them would change rendering. The `styles.css`
    post-processing this option replaces does remove them.
  - Reachability cannot be proven for every reference. A token named by a path the source does not spell out as a string
    literal — `token.var(key)` — one used only from a stylesheet outside `include`, or one consumed by a separate
    package treating the output as design tokens, is invisible. Keep those with `staticCss`.

  Pruning runs wherever a complete stylesheet is assembled — `bamboo`, `bamboo cssgen`, watch mode and the PostCSS
  plugin — and never on a partial one such as `cssgen tokens`, where nothing would be left to reference the tokens.
  Collecting the references reads every source file, so that work stays behind the flag.

### Patch Changes

- 5b16a67: Emit a `package.json` into the generated output so bundlers can tree-shake the barrels.

  The output is a plain directory rather than an installed package, so it carried no `sideEffects` hint and bundlers had
  to assume every module mutates something. Nothing a barrel reached could be dropped:
  `import { Box } from 'styled-system/jsx'` retained all twenty pattern modules, and a deep import at
  `styled-system/jsx/box.mjs` — which nobody writes — produced a materially smaller bundle than the documented one.

  Declaring `sideEffects` closes that gap. A barrel import now costs what the deep import costs: 41.2 KB to 34.1 KB
  minified, 12.6 KB to 10.7 KB gzipped, with nineteen unused pattern modules dropped. The patterns barrel improves by
  about 26%; recipes scale with how many are defined. In a real Vite build of `sandbox/vite-ts` — an app that does use
  several patterns, so it sees less than the ceiling — JS goes from 242.22 KB to 236.95 KB with the CSS byte-identical.

  Two details in the emitted file are load-bearing:
  - `sideEffects` lists CSS globs rather than being a bare `false`. A bare `false` permits a bundler to drop
    `import 'styled-system/styles.css'`, which is how the stylesheet reaches CLI-flow apps. Vite happens to retain CSS
    imports regardless, but webpack historically does not. Both `*.css` and `**/*.css` are listed because the stylesheet
    is emitted at the root and, under `splitting`, in `styles/`.
  - `type` is set to `module`. Adding a `package.json` makes the output its own package boundary, so `.js` output would
    stop inheriting the consumer's `type` and be re-read as CommonJS. The emitted code is always ESM. This is a no-op
    under the default `mjs` extension and only matters for `outExtension: 'js'`.
  - `private` is set, and the file stays nameless. That same package boundary lets a workspace glob match the output
    directory — this repo's own `packages/**` now does — so it is marked unpublishable, and left unnamed so that several
    outputs in one workspace cannot collide.

  Unlike the rest of the output, `package.json` is not exclusively ours — `emit-pkg` writes entrypoints to the same path
  and consumers hand-edit it — so it is merged rather than overwritten. Only absent keys are filled in: an existing
  `exports` map survives, and a deliberate `sideEffects` or `type` is left as it stands. A file that cannot be parsed as
  JSON is reported and skipped rather than replaced. The merged file keeps its trailing newline, so a consumer who
  tracks it in source control does not see a diff on every codegen.

  `emit-pkg` had to learn the other half of that arrangement. It used to write a whole package only when the directory
  had none, and codegen now always leaves one there, so it would have contributed an entrypoint map to a nameless
  `private` file and stopped — no `name`, no `version`, no `license`, nothing publishable or resolvable. It now reads a
  file without a `name` as ours: it supplies the identity that file lacks and lifts the `private` flag that kept a
  nameless directory unpublishable, which is the whole point of running it. A file that already carries a `name` belongs
  to the consumer and is still left alone but for `exports`.

  This only affects what bundlers may discard, so no CSS output or class name changes.

- 5b881ee: Re-parse importers when a shared style file changes in watch mode.

  Cross-file extraction folds an imported value into the importing file's output, so editing `styles.ts` had to re-parse
  everyone importing it — watch only re-parsed and rebundled the changed file, leaving consumers emitting the previous
  styles until the process restarted.

  The parser now records a reverse dependency graph while parsing, covering both imports and re-exports, and exposes
  `project.getDependents(filePath)` for the transitive set. Watch rebundles those alongside the changed file. Edges are
  rebuilt on each parse, so removing an import stops forcing a rebuild of the file it no longer depends on.

- 5b881ee: Use absolute paths consistently in the file watchers.

  The watch handlers removed files by absolute path but reloaded and created them by the path the watcher reported,
  which is relative to the working directory. A reload that fails to match the file the project holds does nothing and
  returns quietly, leaving the edit unread — and with cross-file extraction, an unread edit also leaves every importer
  emitting the previous styles.

  A newly added file now also rebuilds the files importing it, since it can satisfy an import that previously resolved
  to nothing.

- 5b881ee: Build the stylesheet once per edit, not once per affected file.

  The stylesheet is built from the whole parser result, so rebuilding it per file meant one edit to a shared style file
  ran the full optimize pipeline and wrote to disk once for every file importing it — 61 builds and 61 writes for a file
  with 60 importers. Affected files are now re-parsed first and the sheet is built and written a single time.

  A file appearing also reaches the files that were importing it before it existed. Those importers have no dependency
  edge to follow, since the specifier resolved to nothing when they were parsed, so they are tracked separately and
  rebuilt when a new file arrives.

- 5b881ee: Serve fresh values to importers after a shared style file is edited or deleted.

  Resolved values are memoized against the AST node that produced them, but a node's value can come from another file —
  `css(button)` folds whatever `./styles` exports. Editing that file replaces only its own nodes, so an importer's nodes
  stayed identical and kept serving the value read before the edit. Re-parsing the importer was not enough to clear it.

  The memo is now dropped whenever a file's contents are replaced or reloaded, which is the point at which another
  file's resolutions can have gone out of date. Deleting a shared file also rebuilds its importers, resolving them
  before the file leaves the project rather than after, when its path can no longer be matched.

### Minor Changes

- 86b30b1: Add `bamboo spec` command to generate specification files for your theme (useful for documentation). This
  command generates JSON specification files containing metadata, examples, and usage information.

  ```bash
  # Generate all spec files
  bamboo spec

  # Custom output directory
  bamboo spec --outdir custom/specs
  ```

  **Token Spec Structure:**

  ```json
  {
    "type": "tokens",
    "data": [
      {
        "type": "aspectRatios",
        "values": [
          {
            "name": "square",
            "value": "1 / 1",
            "cssVar": "var(--aspect-ratios-square)"
          }
        ],
        "tokenFunctionExamples": ["token('aspectRatios.square')"],
        "functionExamples": ["css({ aspectRatio: 'square' })"],
        "jsxExamples": ["<Box aspectRatio=\"square\" />"]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  **Spec Usage:**

  ```javascript
  import tokens from 'styled-system/specs/tokens'
  import recipes from 'styled-system/specs/recipes'
  ```

  └── styles/
      ├── reset.css           # Preflight/reset CSS
      ├── global.css          # Global CSS
      ├── tokens.css          # Design tokens
      ├── utilities.css       # Utility classes
      ├── recipes/
      │   ├── index.css       # @imports all recipe files

      └── themes/
          └── {theme}.css     # Theme tokens (not auto-imported)
  ```

  Usage:

      root: {

      label: {

    variants: {
      size: {
        sm: {
          root: {
            padding: '10px',
          },

## 0.32.0

### Minor Changes

- de4d9ef: Allow `config.hooks` to be shared in `plugins`

  For hooks that can transform Bamboo's internal state by returning something (like `cssgen:done` and
  `codegen:prepare`), each hook instance will be called sequentially and the return result (if any) of the previous hook
  call is passed to the next hook so that they can be chained together.

## 0.31.0

### Minor Changes

- f0296249: - Sort the longhand/shorthand atomic rules in a deterministic order to prevent property conflicts
  - Automatically merge the `base` object in the `css` root styles in the runtime
  - This may be a breaking change depending on how your styles are created

  Ex:

  ```ts
  css({
    padding: '1px',
    paddingTop: '3px',
    paddingBottom: '4px',
  })
  ```

  Will now always generate the following css:

  ```css
  @layer utilities {
    .p_1px {
      padding: 1px;
    }

    .pt_3px {
      padding-top: 3px;
    }

    .pb_4px {
      padding-bottom: 4px;
    }
  }
  ```

## 0.30.0

### Patch Changes

- 05686b9d: Refactor the `--cpu-prof` profiler to use the `node:inspector` instead of relying on an external module
  (`v8-profiler-next`, which required `node-gyp`)
- ab32d1d7: Introduce 3 new hooks:

  ## `tokens:created`

  This hook is called when the token engine has been created. You can use this hook to add your format token names and
  variables.

  > This is especially useful when migrating from other css-in-js libraries, like Stitches.

  ```ts
  export default defineConfig({
    // ...
    hooks: {
      'tokens:created': ({ configure }) => {
        configure({
          formatTokenName: (path) => '
  ```

  - @bamboocss/token-dictionary@0.29.1
  - @bamboocss/types@0.29.1

## 0.29.0

### Minor Changes

- a2fb5cc6: - Add support for explicitly specifying config related files that should trigger a context reload on change.

  > We automatically track the config file and (transitive) files imported by the config file as much as possible, but
  > sometimes we might miss some. You can use this option as a workaround for those edge cases.

  Set the `dependencies` option in `bamboo.config.ts` to a glob or list of files.

  ```ts
  export default defineConfig({
    // ...
    dependencies: ['path/to/files/**.ts'],
  })
  ```

  - Invoke `config:change` hook in more situations (when the `--watch` flag is passed to `bamboo codegen`,
    `bamboo cssgen`, `bamboo ship`)

  - Watch for more config options paths changes, so that the related artifacts will be regenerated a bit more reliably
    (ex: updating the `config.hooks` will now trigger a full regeneration of `styled-system`)

## 0.28.0

### Minor Changes

- f58f6df2: Refactor `config.hooks` to be much more powerful, you can now:
  - Tweak the config after it has been resolved (after presets are loaded and merged), this could be used to dynamically
    load all `recipes` from a folder
  - Transform a source file's content before parsing it, this could be used to transform the file content to a
    `tsx`-friendly syntax so that Bamboo's parser can parse it.
  - Implement your own parser logic and add the extracted results to the classic Bamboo pipeline, this could be used to
    parse style usage from any template language
  - Tweak the CSS content for any `@layer` or even right before it's written to disk (if using the CLI) or injected
    through the postcss plugin, allowing all kinds of customizations like removing the unused CSS variables, etc.
  - React to any config change or after the codegen step (your outdir, the `styled-system` folder) have been generated

  See the list of available `config.hooks` here:

  ```ts
  export interface BambooHooks {
    /**
     * Called when the config is resolved, after all the presets are loaded and merged.
     * This is the first hook called, you can use it to tweak the config before the context is created.
     */
    'config:resolved': (args: { conf: LoadConfigResult }) => MaybeAsyncReturn
    /**
     * Called when the Bamboo context has been created and the API is ready to be used.
     */
    'context:created': (args: { ctx: ApiInterface; logger: LoggerInterface }) => void
    /**
     * Called when the config file or one of its dependencies (imports) has changed.
     */
    'config:change': (args: { config: UserConfig }) => MaybeAsyncReturn
    /**
     * Called after reading the file content but before parsing it.
     * You can use this hook to transform the file content to a tsx-friendly syntax so that Bamboo's parser can parse it.
     * You can also use this hook to parse the file's content on your side using a custom parser, in this case you don't have to return anything.
     */
    'parser:before': (args: { filePath: string; content: string }) => string | void
    /**
     * Called after the file styles are extracted and processed into the resulting ParserResult object.
     * You can also use this hook to add your own extraction results from your custom parser to the ParserResult object.
     */
    'parser:after': (args: { filePath: string; result: ParserResultInterface | undefined }) => void
    /**
     * Called after the codegen is completed
     */
    'codegen:done': () => MaybeAsyncReturn
    /**
     * Called right before adding the design-system CSS (global, static, preflight, tokens, keyframes) to the final CSS
     * Called right before writing/injecting the final CSS (styles.css) that contains the design-system CSS and the parser CSS
     * You can use it to tweak the CSS content before it's written to disk or injected through the postcss plugin.
     */
    'cssgen:done': (args: {
      artifact: 'global' | 'static' | 'reset' | 'tokens' | 'keyframes' | 'styles.css'
      content: string
    }) => string | void
  }
  ```

### Patch Changes

- f255342f: Add a `--cpu-prof` flag to `bamboo`, `bamboo cssgen`, `bamboo codegen` and `bamboo debug` commands This is
  useful for debugging performance issues in `bamboo` itself. This will generate a
  `bamboo-{command}-{timestamp}.cpuprofile` file in the current working directory, which can be opened in tools like
  [Speedscope](https://www.speedscope.app/)

  This is mostly intended for maintainers or can be asked by maintainers to help debug issues.

## 0.27.0

### Minor Changes

- 84304901: Improve performance, mostly for the CSS generation by removing a lot of `postcss` usage (and plugins).

  ## Public changes:
  - Introduce a new `config.lightningcss` option to use `lightningcss` (currently disabled by default) instead of
    `postcss`.
  - Add a new `config.browserslist` option to configure the browserslist used by `lightningcss`.
  - Add a `--lightningcss` flag to the `bamboo` and `bamboo cssgen` command to use `lightningcss` instead of `postcss`
    for this run.

  ## Internal changes:
  - `markImportant` fn from JS instead of walking through postcss AST nodes
  - use a fork of `stitches` `stringify` function instead of `postcss-css-in-js` to write the CSS string from a JS

  - refactor `serializeStyle` to use the same code path as the rest of the pipeline with `StyleEncoder` / `StyleDecoder`
    and rename it to `transformStyles` to better convey what it does

## 0.26.0

### Minor Changes

- 1bd7fbb7: Fix `@bamboocss/postcss` plugin regression when the entry CSS file (with `@layer` rules order) contains
  user-defined rules, those user-defined rules would not be reloaded correctly after being changed.

### Patch Changes

- 1bd7fbb7: Fix an edge-case for when the `config.outdir` would not be set in the `bamboo.config`

  Internal details: The `outdir` would not have any value after a config change due to the fallback being set in the
  initial config resolving code path but not in context reloading code path, moving it inside the config loading
  function fixes this issue.

## 0.22.0

### Patch Changes

- a2f6c2c8: Fix potential cross-platform issues with path resolving by using `pathe` instead of `path`
- 11753fea: Improve initial css extraction time by at least 5x 🚀

  Initial extraction time can get slow when using static CSS with lots of recipes or parsing a lot of files.

  **Scenarios**
  - Park UI went from 3500ms to 580ms (6x faster)
  - Bamboo Website went from 2900ms to 208ms (14x faster)

  **Potential Breaking Change**

  If you use `hooks` in your `bamboo.config` file to listen for when css is extracted, we no longer return the `css`
  string for performance reasons. We might reconsider this in the future.

## 0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- 12281ff8: Improve support for styled element composition. This ensures that you can compose two styled elements
  together and the styles will be merged correctly.

  ```jsx
  const Box = styled('div', {
    base: {
      background: 'red.light',
      color: 'white',
    },
  })

  const ExtendedBox = styled(Box, {
    base: { background: 'red.dark' },
  })

  // <ExtendedBox> will have a background of `red.dark` and a color of `white`
  ```

  **Limitation:** This feature does not allow compose mixed styled composition. A mixed styled composition happens when
  an element is created from a cva/inline cva, and another created from a config recipe.
  - CVA or Inline CVA + CVA or Inline CVA = ✅
  - Config Recipe + Config Recipe = ✅
  - CVA or Inline CVA + Config Recipe = ❌

  ```jsx
  import { button } from '../styled-system/recipes'

  const Button = styled('div', button)

  // ❌ This will throw an error
  const ExtendedButton = styled(Button, {
    base: { background: 'red.dark' },
  })
  ```

## 0.16.0

### Minor Changes

- 36252b1d: ## --minimal flag

  Adds a new `--minimal` flag for the CLI on the `bamboo cssgen` command to skip generating CSS for theme tokens,
  preflightkeyframes, static and global css

  Thich means that the generated CSS will only contain the CSS related to the styles found in the included files.

  > Note that you can use a `glob` to override the `config.include` option like this:
  > `bamboo cssgen "src/**/*.css" --minimal`

  This is useful when you want to split your CSS into multiple files, for example if you want to split by pages.

  Use it like this:

  ```bash
  bamboo cssgen "src/**/pages/*.css" --minimal --outfile dist/pages.css
  ```

  ***

  ## cssgen {type}

  In addition to the optional `glob` that you can already pass to override the config.include option, the
  `bamboo cssgen` command now accepts a new `{type}` argument to generate only a specific type of CSS:
  - preflight
  - tokens
  - static
  - global
  - keyframes

  > Note that this only works when passing an `--outfile`.

  You can use it like this:

  ```bash
  bamboo cssgen "static" --outfile dist/static.css
  ```

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 5b09ab3b: Add support for `--outfile` flag in the `cssgen` command.

  ```bash
  bamboo cssgen --outfile dist/styles.css
  ```

- 78ed6ed4: Fix issue where using a nested outdir like `src/styled-system` with a baseUrl like `./src` would result on
  parser NOT matching imports like `import { container } from "styled-system/patterns";` cause it would expect the full
  path `src/styled-system`
- e48b130a: - Remove `stack` from `box.toJSON()` so that generated JSON files have less noise, mostly useful to get make
  the `bamboo debug` command easier to read
  - Also use the `ParserResult.toJSON()` method on `bamboo debug` command for the same reason

  instead of:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "type": "map",
      "value": {
        "padding": {
          "type": "literal",
          "value": "25px",
          "node": "StringLiteral",
          "stack": [
            "CallExpression",
            "ObjectLiteralExpression",
            "PropertyAssignment",
            "Identifier",
            "Identifier",
            "VariableDeclaration",
            "StringLiteral"
          ],
          "line": 10,
          "column": 20
        },
        "fontSize": {
          "type": "literal",
          "value": "2xl",
          "node": "StringLiteral",
          "stack": [
            "CallExpression",
            "ObjectLiteralExpression",
            "PropertyAssignment",
            "ConditionalExpression"
          ],
          "line": 11,
          "column": 67
        }
      },
      "node": "CallExpression",
      "stack": [

        "ObjectLiteralExpression"
      ],
      "line": 11,
      "column": 21
    },
  ```

  we now have:

## `utility:created`

This hook is called when the internal classname engine has been created. You can override the default `toHash` function
used when `config.hash` is set to `true`

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  hooks: {
    'utility:created': ({ configure }) => {
      configure({
        toHash: (paths, toHash) => {
          const stringConds = paths.join(':')
          const splitConds = stringConds.split('_')
          const hashConds = splitConds.map(toHash)
          return hashConds.join('_')
        },
      })
    },
  },
})
````

## `codegen:prepare`

This hook is called right before writing the codegen files to disk. You can use this hook to tweak the codegen files

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  hooks: {
    'codegen:prepare': ({ artifacts, changed }) => {
      // do something with the emitted js/d.ts files
    },
  },
})
```

- d5977c24: - Add a `--logfile` flag to the `bamboo`, `bamboo codegen`, `bamboo cssgen` and `bamboo debug` commands.
  - Add a `logfile` option to the postcss plugin

  Logs will be streamed to the file specified by the `--logfile` flag or the `logfile` option. This is useful for
  debugging issues that occur during the build process.

  ```sh
  bamboo --logfile ./logs/bamboo.log
  ```

  ```js
  module.exports = {
    plugins: {
      '@bamboocss/dev/postcss': {
        logfile: './logs/bamboo.log',
      },
    },
  }

## 0.29.0

### Minor Changes

- a2fb5cc6: - Add support for explicitly specifying config related files that should trigger a context reload on change.

  > We automatically track the config file and (transitive) files imported by the config file as much as possible, but
  > sometimes we might miss some. You can use this option as a workaround for those edge cases.

  Set the `dependencies` option in `bamboo.config.ts` to a glob or list of files.

  ```ts
  export default defineConfig({
    // ...
    dependencies: ['path/to/files/**.ts'],
  })
  ```

  - Invoke `config:change` hook in more situations (when the `--watch` flag is passed to `bamboo codegen`,
    `bamboo cssgen`, `bamboo ship`)

  - Watch for more config options paths changes, so that the related artifacts will be regenerated a bit more reliably
    (ex: updating the `config.hooks` will now trigger a full regeneration of `styled-system`)

## 0.28.0

### Minor Changes

- f58f6df2: Refactor `config.hooks` to be much more powerful, you can now:
  - Tweak the config after it has been resolved (after presets are loaded and merged), this could be used to dynamically
    load all `recipes` from a folder
  - Transform a source file's content before parsing it, this could be used to transform the file content to a
    `tsx`-friendly syntax so that Bamboo's parser can parse it.
  - Implement your own parser logic and add the extracted results to the classic Bamboo pipeline, this could be used to
    parse style usage from any template language
  - Tweak the CSS content for any `@layer` or even right before it's written to disk (if using the CLI) or injected
    through the postcss plugin, allowing all kinds of customizations like removing the unused CSS variables, etc.
  - React to any config change or after the codegen step (your outdir, the `styled-system` folder) have been generated

  See the list of available `config.hooks` here:

  ```ts
  export interface BambooHooks {
    /**
     * Called when the config is resolved, after all the presets are loaded and merged.
     * This is the first hook called, you can use it to tweak the config before the context is created.
     */
    'config:resolved': (args: { conf: LoadConfigResult }) => MaybeAsyncReturn
    /**
     * Called when the Bamboo context has been created and the API is ready to be used.
     */
    'context:created': (args: { ctx: ApiInterface; logger: LoggerInterface }) => void
    /**
     * Called when the config file or one of its dependencies (imports) has changed.
     */
    'config:change': (args: { config: UserConfig }) => MaybeAsyncReturn
    /**
     * Called after reading the file content but before parsing it.
     * You can use this hook to transform the file content to a tsx-friendly syntax so that Bamboo's parser can parse it.
     * You can also use this hook to parse the file's content on your side using a custom parser, in this case you don't have to return anything.
     */
    'parser:before': (args: { filePath: string; content: string }) => string | void
    /**
     * Called after the file styles are extracted and processed into the resulting ParserResult object.
     * You can also use this hook to add your own extraction results from your custom parser to the ParserResult object.
     */
    'parser:after': (args: { filePath: string; result: ParserResultInterface | undefined }) => void
    /**
     * Called after the codegen is completed
     */
    'codegen:done': () => MaybeAsyncReturn
    /**
     * Called right before adding the design-system CSS (global, static, preflight, tokens, keyframes) to the final CSS
     * Called right before writing/injecting the final CSS (styles.css) that contains the design-system CSS and the parser CSS
     * You can use it to tweak the CSS content before it's written to disk or injected through the postcss plugin.
     */
    'cssgen:done': (args: {
      artifact: 'global' | 'static' | 'reset' | 'tokens' | 'keyframes' | 'styles.css'
      content: string
    }) => string | void
  }
  ```

### Patch Changes

- f255342f: Add a `--cpu-prof` flag to `bamboo`, `bamboo cssgen`, `bamboo codegen` and `bamboo debug` commands This is
  useful for debugging performance issues in `bamboo` itself. This will generate a
  `bamboo-{command}-{timestamp}.cpuprofile` file in the current working directory, which can be opened in tools like
  [Speedscope](https://www.speedscope.app/)

  This is mostly intended for maintainers or can be asked by maintainers to help debug issues.

## 0.27.0

### Minor Changes

- 84304901: Improve performance, mostly for the CSS generation by removing a lot of `postcss` usage (and plugins).

  ## Public changes:
  - Introduce a new `config.lightningcss` option to use `lightningcss` (currently disabled by default) instead of
    `postcss`.
  - Add a new `config.browserslist` option to configure the browserslist used by `lightningcss`.
  - Add a `--lightningcss` flag to the `bamboo` and `bamboo cssgen` command to use `lightningcss` instead of `postcss`
    for this run.

  ## Internal changes:
  - `markImportant` fn from JS instead of walking through postcss AST nodes
  - use a fork of `stitches` `stringify` function instead of `postcss-css-in-js` to write the CSS string from a JS
    object
  - only compute once `TokenDictionary` properties
  - refactor `serializeStyle` to use the same code path as the rest of the pipeline with `StyleEncoder` / `StyleDecoder`
    and rename it to `transformStyles` to better convey what it does

### Minor Changes

- 1bd7fbb7: Fix `@bamboocss/postcss` plugin regression when the entry CSS file (with `@layer` rules order) contains
  user-defined rules, those user-defined rules would not be reloaded correctly after being changed.

### Patch Changes

- 1bd7fbb7: Fix an edge-case for when the `config.outdir` would not be set in the `bamboo.config`

  Internal details: The `outdir` would not have any value after a config change due to the fallback being set in the
  initial config resolving code path but not in context reloading code path, moving it inside the config loading
  function fixes this issue.

## 0.22.0

### Patch Changes

- a2f6c2c8: Fix potential cross-platform issues with path resolving by using `pathe` instead of `path`
- 11753fea: Improve initial css extraction time by at least 5x 🚀

  Initial extraction time can get slow when using static CSS with lots of recipes or parsing a lot of files.

  **Scenarios**
  - Park UI went from 3500ms to 580ms (6x faster)
  - Bamboo Website went from 2900ms to 208ms (14x faster)

  **Potential Breaking Change**

  If you use `hooks` in your `bamboo.config` file to listen for when css is extracted, we no longer return the `css`
  string for performance reasons. We might reconsider this in the future.

## 0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- 12281ff8: Improve support for styled element composition. This ensures that you can compose two styled elements
  together and the styles will be merged correctly.

  ```jsx
  const Box = styled('div', {
    base: {
      background: 'red.light',
      color: 'white',
    },
  })

  const ExtendedBox = styled(Box, {
    base: { background: 'red.dark' },
  })

  // <ExtendedBox> will have a background of `red.dark` and a color of `white`
  ```

  **Limitation:** This feature does not allow compose mixed styled composition. A mixed styled composition happens when
  an element is created from a cva/inline cva, and another created from a config recipe.
  - CVA or Inline CVA + CVA or Inline CVA = ✅
  - Config Recipe + Config Recipe = ✅
  - CVA or Inline CVA + Config Recipe = ❌

  ```jsx
  import { button } from '../styled-system/recipes'

  const Button = styled('div', button)

  // ❌ This will throw an error
  const ExtendedButton = styled(Button, {
    base: { background: 'red.dark' },
  })
  ```

## 0.16.0

### Minor Changes

- 36252b1d: ## --minimal flag

  Adds a new `--minimal` flag for the CLI on the `bamboo cssgen` command to skip generating CSS for theme tokens,
  preflightkeyframes, static and global css

  Thich means that the generated CSS will only contain the CSS related to the styles found in the included files.

  > Note that you can use a `glob` to override the `config.include` option like this:
  > `bamboo cssgen "src/**/*.css" --minimal`

  This is useful when you want to split your CSS into multiple files, for example if you want to split by pages.

  Use it like this:

  ```bash
  bamboo cssgen "src/**/pages/*.css" --minimal --outfile dist/pages.css
  ```

  ***

  ## cssgen {type}

  In addition to the optional `glob` that you can already pass to override the config.include option, the
  `bamboo cssgen` command now accepts a new `{type}` argument to generate only a specific type of CSS:
  - preflight
  - tokens
  - static
  - global
  - keyframes

  > Note that this only works when passing an `--outfile`.

  You can use it like this:

  ```bash
  bamboo cssgen "static" --outfile dist/static.css
  ```

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 5b09ab3b: Add support for `--outfile` flag in the `cssgen` command.

  ```bash
  bamboo cssgen --outfile dist/styles.css
  ```

- 78ed6ed4: Fix issue where using a nested outdir like `src/styled-system` with a baseUrl like `./src` would result on
  parser NOT matching imports like `import { container } from "styled-system/patterns";` cause it would expect the full
  path `src/styled-system`
- e48b130a: - Remove `stack` from `box.toJSON()` so that generated JSON files have less noise, mostly useful to get make
  the `bamboo debug` command easier to read
  - Also use the `ParserResult.toJSON()` method on `bamboo debug` command for the same reason

  instead of:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "type": "map",
      "value": {
        "padding": {
          "type": "literal",
          "value": "25px",
          "node": "StringLiteral",
          "stack": [
            "CallExpression",
            "ObjectLiteralExpression",
            "PropertyAssignment",
            "Identifier",
            "Identifier",
            "VariableDeclaration",
            "StringLiteral"
          ],
          "line": 10,
          "column": 20
        },
        "fontSize": {
          "type": "literal",
          "value": "2xl",
          "node": "StringLiteral",
          "stack": [
            "CallExpression",
            "ObjectLiteralExpression",
            "PropertyAssignment",
            "ConditionalExpression"
          ],
          "line": 11,
          "column": 67
        }
      },
      "node": "CallExpression",
      "stack": [
        "CallExpression",
        "ObjectLiteralExpression"
      ],
      "line": 11,
      "column": 21
    },
  ```

  we now have:

  ```json
  {
    "css": [
      {
        "type": "object",
        "name": "css",
        "box": {
          "type": "map",
          "value": {},
          "node": "CallExpression",
          "line": 15,
          "column": 27
        },
        "data": [
          {
            "alignItems": "center",
            "backgroundColor": "white",
            "border": "1px solid black",
            "borderRadius": "8px",
            "display": "flex",
            "gap": "16px",
            "p": "8px",
            "pr": "16px"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "cva": [],
    "recipe": {
      "checkboxRoot": [
        {
          "type": "recipe",
          "name": "checkboxRoot",
          "box": {
            "type": "map",
            "value": {},
            "node": "CallExpression",
            "line": 38,
            "column": 47
          },
          "data": [
            {}
          ]
        }
      ],
  ```
