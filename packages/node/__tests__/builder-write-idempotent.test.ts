/**
 * `isValidRoot` reads only the `@layer` statement, and that statement is ordinary css —
 * listing every layer in order is what a project has to write once it has layers of its own
 * beside bamboo's. So a file that both imports `styles.css` and declares the order satisfies
 * the guard while already holding the sheet, and `write` appending gave it a second copy on
 * every build.
 *
 * It hid well. Vite puts `postcss-import` at the front of the chain, so the artifact is
 * inlined before any plugin runs; then a minifier merges the two `@layer X{}` blocks and
 * dedupes most of the collision, leaving a fraction behind — 11% of one production
 * stylesheet, which reads as a rounding error rather than as the whole sheet twice.
