 * A recipe's classes are named from a hash of its config, so a declaration the build cannot
 * see changes the hash — the build emits rules under one name, the browser asks for another,
 * and the element renders with no styles at all.
 *
 * That is worse than the `css()` case this detection was originally written for. Grouping
 * loses only the declarations it could not see, so what it *did* resolve still applies. A
 * diverged hash has no such partial recovery, which is why this check reports in full.
