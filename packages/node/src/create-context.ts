/**
 * Report a failed rebuild as a failed rebuild.
 *
 * Chokidar is an `EventEmitter`, so it discards whatever a listener returns, and the debounce
 * wrapper attaches no rejection handler — a throw from inside a rebuild became a dangling
 * promise. `node-runtime.ts` then catches it as `Unhandled rejection`, which labels a config
 * error as an internal crash, leaves the exit code at 0, and is suppressed entirely at
 * `logLevel: 'silent'`. The initial build is caught by the CLI and prints properly; only
 * rebuilds of the identical source were silent, which is the worse half of the asymmetry.
 *
 * Caught rather than rethrown: a watcher's job is to survive a bad intermediate state and
 * rebuild when the next edit fixes it. What it must not do is claim success.
