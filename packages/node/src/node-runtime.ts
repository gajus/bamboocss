/**
 * What the source glob ignores.
 *
 * `**\/*.d.ts` is unconditional. It used to be a *default* that a user's own `exclude`
 * replaced, so declaration files were scanned by whether the project happened to set that
 * option at all — excluded for `exclude: []`, included for `exclude: ['**\/*.stories.tsx']`.
 * Nothing chose that; the default was simply appended when nothing else was there.
 *
 * A declaration file carries no runtime code and can emit no styles. It is still read by the
 * reference scans, which are deliberately over-inclusive, so scanning one could keep a token
 * named in a doc comment or a reset rule for an element named in a JSDoc example. Those are
 * spurious keeps rather than a guarantee anyone relied on — and they were never available to
 * the projects on the other side of the same condition.
 *
 * Copied rather than appended to. `opts.exclude` is `ctx.config.exclude` itself, so pushing
 * onto it edited the user's resolved config in place, and the next call then saw a list it had
 * mutated.

/**
 * The order the source glob returns files in, made a decision rather than an accident.
 *
 * `fast-glob` hands back whatever `readdir` gave it, which is the filesystem's order and is not
 * the same on every machine. That order is not cosmetic: it is the order atoms enter the sheet,
 * and sheet order is what decides a conflict between two classes on one element — `cx` joins
 * them and the browser picks by position, not by the order they were passed. So an unsorted
 * glob lets two checkouts of the same commit build stylesheets that resolve the same conflict
 * differently, and makes the emitted bytes irreproducible, which is also what content-hashed
 * asset caching is keyed on.
 *
 * Sorted by code unit rather than `localeCompare`, whose answer depends on the host's locale —
 * the exact class of machine-dependence this exists to remove.
