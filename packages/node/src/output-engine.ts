  /**
   * Delete files in the generated directories that this codegen no longer produces.
   *
   * Codegen was write-only, so an artifact that stopped being generated stayed on disk
   * forever. Dropping a pattern from the config rewrote `patterns/index.js` without it and
   * left `patterns/stack.js` sitting beside it — importing through the barrel then failed
   * loudly, which is fine, but a deep import resolved, ran, returned a class name and
   * emitted no css. A stale artifact is worse than a missing one: it answers.
   *
   * Scoped to the directories this call actually wrote to, so a directory bamboo does not
   * generate into is never read, let alone emptied. It is bounded twice over, because the
   * cost of being wrong here is a deleted file rather than a stale one:
   *
   * - only a *complete* codegen may be swept, since a filtered artifact list cannot say what
   *   a directory should contain. That is the caller's to enforce;
   * - within a directory, only files carrying an extension this codegen actually wrote
   *   *there* are eligible. `patterns/` got `.mjs` and `.d.ts` files, so a leftover
   *   `stack.mjs` is stale; a `.gitignore`, a `README.md` or a `styles.css` is not the kind
   *   of thing we put there and is none of our business.
   *
   * The second bound replaces a list of known exceptions, which was the wrong shape: a
   * denylist has to name every file anyone might legitimately keep in an output directory,
   * and the failure mode when it misses one is silent deletion. It missed the `.gitignore`
   * that ships inside a generated directory, which is committed in this repo's own fixtures.
   * Reasoning from what we wrote needs no such list.
   *
   * Subdirectories are left alone; they are swept as themselves when their own artifacts
   * are written.
