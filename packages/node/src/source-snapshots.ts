/**
 * Every file `include` covers, read once.
 *
 * The scans that decide what survives pruning — the token reference set, the reachability
 * gate, the strict accounting — all want the same two copies of the same files, and each used
 * to fetch them itself. A strict build therefore read every file three times over: once to
 * collect references, once to account, and once more for the gate whenever the accounting
 * declined. Yielding a snapshot lets one walk feed all of them.
 *
 * Both copies, because neither alone is complete and the text scans are safe when over-fed. A
 * file the parser transformed is stored rewritten (`parseSourceFile` calls `replaceWithText`),
 * and those transforms lose things the scans want: `svelteToTsx` and `vueToTsx` each swallow a
 * throw and return an empty string, and a Vue SFC with a render function and no `<template>`
 * becomes the literal `<template>undefined</template>`. Read only the parsed copy and a file
 * like that reports no tokens and no elements at all.
 *
 * The parsed copy still has to be read as well, because `parser:before` is the documented way
 * to teach bamboo a format it does not know. A template compiled to jsx by such a hook holds
 * nothing a scan of the raw file would recognise, and that is the hook working as intended.
