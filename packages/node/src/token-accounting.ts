 * hands back a `var()` for every token, so an unreadable path could name any of them, and a

 * it — the guaranteed-invalid value, which inherits rather than falling back. Silently wrong.
 *
 * Two properties make that safe to act on:
 *
 * - **Accepted implies recorded.** The code that accepts a reference records its path in the
 *   same step, so there is no second derivation to disagree with. An earlier attempt at this
 *   accepted shapes from the syntax tree while a separate text regex built the keep set; the
 *   regex needed the literal identifier `token`, so `import { token as t }` then
 *   `t('colors.red.300')` was accepted and kept nothing, and the declaration went while the
 *   app asked for it. Recording at the point of acceptance is what makes that unrepresentable.
 * - **Declining is free.** A decline keeps every declaration, which is exactly what happens
 *   today. So every branch that cannot prove a shape declines, and the accepted set below is
 *   deliberately small.
 *
 * What it cannot see is a caller *outside* `include`, which scopes style extraction rather than
 * everything that may import — a script, a config, a sibling workspace package consuming the
 * output as design tokens. Nothing here declines for those, because nothing here can see them, so
 * no fallback covers them either: `prune.keepTokens` is the only answer, and `prune.unresolvedPath`
 * is what makes the declines this *can* see visible.
 *
 * That blind spot used to be covered by accident. The old default kept every declaration the
 * moment any javascript reached for a token at all, so a project with one `token()` call in it
 * protected its out-of-`include` readers without meaning to — and a project with none did not.
 * Consistency in the pruning direction is the trade this made deliberately.
