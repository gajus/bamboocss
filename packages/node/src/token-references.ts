 * all is one a decline cannot endanger, so it keeps nothing extra.
 *
 * The awkward part is that a token reference inside a css value is now spelled `token(…)` too,
 * and it must *not* count: `css({ border: '1px solid token(colors.red.300)' })` reaches a token
 * from a stylesheet, where the css scan already accounts for it, not from javascript. Reading it
 * as a call turned pruning off wholesale — measured at 3.2x the stylesheet on a sandbox, since
 * "keep everything" is what the gate means. It was only ever latent before, because `{…}` was
 * the spelling the docs used and it looked nothing like a call.
 *
 * So a `token(` that survives blanking every string literal is a real call, and one that does
 * not was written inside a string. The literal-argument test comes first and on the raw text,
 * which is what keeps this a superset of `TOKEN_CALL` as the coupling in `collectTokenReferences`
 * requires: a resolvable call embedded in a template literal — a fixture holding source code —
 * still counts, even though blanking would hide it.

 * This is deliberately textual and therefore over-inclusive: a match inside a comment or
 * a string that is never evaluated keeps a token alive. Keeping a token that is not used
 * costs bytes; dropping one that is breaks the page, so the bias belongs on this side.
 *
 * `results` is a second, redundant source for the same paths: the extractor resolves one
 * built from a constant — for `token.value()` as well as `token()` — which
 * the text scan reads literally and fails to look up. Callers that cannot supply it — the
 * watch rebuild and the PostCSS plugin, where re-parsing would encode every style a second
 * time — pass none, and stay correct only because a path the scan misses can lose nothing:
 * `getAlwaysKeptTokenVars` keeps every token's declaration once anything reaches for a token
 * from javascript at all.
 *
 * That blanket keep used to be narrower, covering only the virtual, conditional and negative
 * tokens `token()` returned a `var()` for. It cannot be, now that `token()` returns the
 * reference for *every* token: a path this scan could not resolve could name any of them.
 *
 * The keeps are still not unconditional — `tokensReachableFromJs` gates them — and that gate
 * is what the argument above rests on. The gate matches `token(` regardless of what follows,
 * where `TOKEN_CALL` below needs a string literal. So the one shape this scan cannot resolve,
 * a path built from a constant, is exactly the shape that turns the gate on and restores
 * every keep. The two failures line up, which is what makes the redundancy hold.
 *
 * That alignment is a real coupling, not an observation: the gate's call pattern has to stay
 * a superset of this one, matching wherever `TOKEN_CALL` matches and also wherever it gives
 * up. It briefly was not — this allowed whitespace around the `.` of the method and the gate
 * did not, so a formatter wrapping `token\n  .value(SOME_CONST)` slipped past both. Change one
 * of the two and change the other; `token-references.test.ts` pins the property directly.
 *
 * Where it stops holding is a binding renamed away from `token` — `const t = token`, then
 * `t('spacing.4')` — which matches neither. `token-references.test.ts` pins both halves.

 *
 * The commoner blind spot is nearer than a dependency: this reads `include`, and `include`
 * conventionally covers components rather than markup. An entry template — `index.html`,
 * `app.html` — is where `<table>`, `<noscript>` and a page's static markup usually live, and a
 * glob rooted at `./src` does not match it, so every element appearing only there loses its

/**
 * Whether any source file reaches for a token from javascript.

 * The tokens artifact is generated into the project rather than installed, so the import is
 * written in the project's own source and a scan of `include` sees it. When this comes back
 * false, the declarations kept purely so `token()` can answer have no caller to answer.
 *
 * Deliberately loose, and loose in a specific direction: a false positive keeps a declaration
 * nothing reads, a false negative returns a `var()` nothing declares.
 *
 * So the import test is any module specifier with a `/tokens` path segment, rather than the
 * literal `styled-system/tokens` it used to be. `outdir` is configurable, so the artifact is
 * only at `styled-system/` by default, and the literal missed `outdir: 'design-system'`, a
 * tsconfig path alias, and `styled-system/tokens/index.mjs`. It is still anchored to `from`,
 * `import` or `require`, because without that anchor a route or a url (`fetch('/api/tokens')`)
 * reads as an import and quietly switches the whole optimisation off.
 *
 * That last spelling used to be the only one NodeNext accepted, the artifact being a directory
 * and the generated `package.json` declaring no `exports`. It declares one now, so
 * `styled-system/tokens` resolves there too — but both spellings still have to be seen here,
 * because the map keeps the explicit one working and projects have it written down.
 *
 * The call test allows whitespace around the dot for the same reason `TOKEN_CALL` does. It
 * did not, which broke the alignment the note on `collectTokenReferences` rests on: a
 * formatter wrapping `token\n  .var(SOME_CONST)` was invisible to that scan *and* to this
 * gate *and* to the parser, whose callee is a property access. A comment in the same position
 * -- `token/*x*\/.var(` -- is still invisible to all three.
 *
 * One shape it still does not see, pinned in `token-references.test.ts`: a binding renamed
 * away from `token`, as in `const t = token`. Also unseen is a caller outside `include`,
 * which scopes style extraction rather than everything that may import — a script, a config,
 * or a sibling workspace package. Both prune declarations the running app then asks for, and
 * neither reports itself. `prune: { keepTokens: [...] }` names what they reach; `prune: { tokens:
