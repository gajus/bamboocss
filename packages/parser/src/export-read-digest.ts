/**
 * A digest of what one exported name resolves to right now, or `undefined` when the answer
 * cannot be pinned down.
 *
 * This is the witness the read-verification protocol compares: a dependent records the digest
 * of every cross-file value it folded, and an edit to the exporting file is verified by
 * recomputing the same digest through the same resolution path. The two sides must therefore
 * be the *same function* -- recorded at parse time, recomputed at verification time -- or
 * equal values would compare unequal and every edit would fall back to a full re-fold.
 *
 * `undefined` is the conservative verdict, and everything unusual maps to it: a missing
 * initializer, an evaluation the bare context cannot resolve (a value built through the
 * parser's evaluation environment, say), a conditional value, a non-serializable result, a
 * throw. An export that stopped existing is *not* unknown -- it digests to a distinct
 * sentinel, so its consumers read as changed rather than unverifiable.
 *
 * Serialized with insertion order preserved: property order is part of a style value's
 * meaning, so reordering keys must read as a change. `undefined` leaves inside the value are
 * kept visible through a sentinel, since `JSON.stringify` would otherwise erase the
 * difference between an unresolvable member and an absent one.
