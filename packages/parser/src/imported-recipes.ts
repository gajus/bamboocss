 * extractor never recorded the call, and the fold saw nothing at all — neither a fold nor a
 * decline. A build could not distinguish "no recipe calls here" from "380 of them, none of
 * which anything looked at".
 *
 * Resolved through the *caller's* module resolver rather than `getModuleSpecifierSourceFile`
 * or a symbol's aliases. Both of those go through the symbol table, which forces
 * `initializeTypeChecker`; measured here it cost 4.5x on `parse only`, which is the same
 * trap `Project.resolveImport` documents avoiding. Everything below is a syntax walk over
 * statements the parser has already loaded.
