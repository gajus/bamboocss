### Minor Changes

- aecf2b1: Collapse the pattern set from 18 to 12, removing the ones that were another pattern with defaults frozen.

  `stack`, `hstack`, `vstack` and `wrap` were all `flex`. Write the default you want instead — and note the 8px gap they
  applied for you is now yours to choose:

  ```ts
  flex({ direction: 'column', gap: '8px' }) // was stack()
  flex({ align: 'center', gap: '8px' }) // was hstack()
  flex({ direction: 'column', align: 'center', gap: '8px' }) // was vstack()
  flex({ wrap: 'wrap', gap: '8px' }) // was wrap()
  ```

  `square` and `circle` were `center` with a size, which `center` now takes:

  ```ts
  center({ size: '12' }) // was square({ size: '12' })
  center({ size: '12', borderRadius: 'full' }) // was circle({ size: '12' })
  ```

  `cq` renamed two props onto `containerType` and `containerName` and defaulted the first. `containerName` is already a
  utility typed against the `containerNames` theme key, so write the declarations:

  ```ts
  css({ containerType: 'inline-size', containerName: 'sidebar' }) // was cq({ name: 'sidebar' })
  ```

  `center` gains `size`, which sets `width` and `height` together and pins `flex: 0 0 auto` so a flex parent cannot
  shrink the result. An unsized `center` is unchanged.

- 1243f93: Remove the `hideFrom` and `hideBelow` utilities, leaving the breakpoint conditions as the one way to hide by
  width.

  Both set `display: none` inside a media query the conditions already express, so the migration is the declaration
  itself:

  ```ts
  css({ md: { display: 'none' } }) //     was css({ hideFrom: 'md' })
  css({ mdDown: { display: 'none' } }) // was css({ hideBelow: 'md' })
  ```

  The emitted media queries are unchanged — `(width >= 48rem)` and `(width < 48rem)` — only the class name differs, and
  `packages/core/__tests__/atomic-rule.test.ts` now asserts the condition form against the queries the utilities used to
  produce.

  A width no breakpoint names was the one thing the utilities took that a condition does not, and an arbitrary at-rule
  covers it:

  ```ts
  css({ '@media (width < 800px)': { display: 'none' } })
  ```

  That case is also why they are worth removing rather than keeping as sugar: the two spellings had already drifted
  apart there. `hideBelow` resolved a raw value to an inclusive `max-width` and a breakpoint token to an exclusive
  range, so `hideBelow="800px"` and an `800px` breakpoint disagreed at exactly 800px. One spelling cannot disagree with
  itself.

### Minor Changes

- 8fb87ac: **Config options are renamed and removed in this release.** It ships as a minor, so nothing in the version
  signals it — the migration notes below are the warning. Every removed or renamed option is reported by name on the
  next build, with the edit to make.

  Settle the config surface before the API freezes: remove the options that were a second way to say something the
  config already said, and rename the ones whose names disagreed with each other.

  Every removed or renamed option is reported by name on the next build, with the edit to make. An unknown key is
  otherwise ignored in silence, which would mean the build reverting to a default without saying so.

  **`strict` now means exactly one thing.** It was six options across three packages covering three unrelated concerns.
  `strictTokens` and `strictPropertyValues` are unchanged and are the only remaining use of the word — both narrow
  generated TypeScript and neither affects a build.
  - `vite.strict` → `vite.failOnUnfolded`. Named for what it checks.
  - `PatternConfig.strict` + `PatternConfig.blocklist` → `PatternConfig.cssProps: 'all' | 'none' | { except }`. These
    were two answers to one question, and setting both silently dropped the blocklist — it is only applied to the type
    that `strict: true` does not emit.
  - `validation: 'none'` → `validation: 'off'`, matching `prune`.

  **`prune` separates the strategy from the report.**
  - `prune.tokens` takes `'off' | 'reachable' | 'accounted'` instead of a boolean.
  - `prune.unresolved` → `prune.unresolvedPath`, and is now orthogonal: the accounting pass is `tokens: 'accounted'`,
    the severity is `unresolvedPath`. `'off'` used to mean both "do not account" and "do not report", which left
    "account, and stay quiet" unsayable.
  - `prune.propertyRegistrations` is new. Dropping unreachable `@property` registrations was a side effect of
    `prune.tokens`, and happened even when it was off — so an option documented as keeping every token declaration
    quietly removed something else, and nothing could keep them.

  **Four `global*` keys become one.** `globalCss`, `globalFontface`, `globalPositionTry` and `globalVars` are
  `global.css`, `global.fontface`, `global.positionTry` and `global.vars`. `globalVars` was the one of the four
  `PresetCore` never listed, so it kept its `extend` wrapper in the resolved config while its siblings lost theirs.

  **`themes` becomes `theme.variants`.** One character from `theme`, both spellings valid, so the typo resolved to a
  different feature rather than to an error.

  **`presets` is authoritative.** What the config lists is what is loaded; an unset `presets` loads `defaultPresets`,
  exported from `@bamboocss/dev/presets`. `eject` is removed — `presets: []` is what it meant. Previously, listing any
  preset kept `@bamboocss/preset-base` and silently dropped `@bamboocss/preset-bamboo`, so `presets` was neither
  additive nor replacing, and `presets: []` meant "base only" rather than "none". A config that lists presets without
  `preset-base` now warns, because the change is otherwise silent: `preset-base` carries the utility table, so dropping
  it changes every generated class name rather than raising an error.

  ```ts
  import { defaultPresets } from '@bamboocss/dev/presets'

  export default defineConfig({ presets: [...defaultPresets, myPreset] })
  ```

  **`lightningcss` is removed; list the plugin instead.** Its only job was to push `pluginLightningcss()` into
  `plugins`. Naming the plugin from inside `@bamboocss/node` made it a static import, so
  `@bamboocss/plugin-lightningcss` — and the `lightningcss` native binary behind it — installed with every project
  whether or not the flag was set. It is a separate package so that cost can be opt-in.

  ```ts
  import { pluginLightningcss } from '@bamboocss/plugin-lightningcss'

  export default defineConfig({ plugins: [pluginLightningcss()] })
  ```

  **Fixes**
  - `validation` no longer switches off removed-option detection. Setting it to `'none'` returned before that check ran,
    so the one mechanism that tells an upgrader their setting is no longer read was disabled by a severity setting.
  - `forceConsistentTypeExtension` now emits import specifiers as `./x.mjs` rather than `./x.d.mts`, which is only legal
    under `allowImportingTsExtensions`. The flag previously emitted imports that did not resolve.

- 8fb87ac: Remove the `box` and `visuallyHidden` patterns. Each was a second spelling of something the system already
  had.

  `box(styles)` declared no styles of its own — its transform was `props => props` — so it was exactly `css(styles)`.
  The docs said so outright. `visuallyHidden()` was `{ srOnly: true }`, wrapping a utility that already exists.

  ```ts
  box({ color: 'blue.300' })  →  css({ color: 'blue.300' })
  visuallyHidden()            →  css({ srOnly: true })
  ```

  Both were exports, so this had to happen before the API settles rather than after. Neither removal is silent: the
  import fails to resolve and the pattern module is gone from the generated output.

  Each also cost more than a name. A pattern is emitted as its own module that imports the tokens artifact to build its
  transform helpers — 46 KB raw, 6.3 KB gzipped — whether or not its transform ever calls `token()`. Neither of these
  did, so any bundle importing them retained the token map to run `props => props`.

  You can still declare either one in your own `patterns` config if you prefer the name.

- 678bdee: Remove `token(path, fallback)`. A token is referenced one way: `token(path)`.

  The fallback bundled two unrelated behaviours under one spelling — "resolve this, or use the literal if it names no
  token", answered at build time, and "emit `var(--x, fallback)`", answered by the browser. The call site could not say
  which it was getting, and the build-time half silently masked a typo'd path, which is the same reason the `fallback`
  argument was removed from `token.value()`.

  **Patterns resolve tokens directly now.** `PatternHelpers` gains `token(path, fallback)`:

  ```ts
  // before — deferred into a string for the css pipeline to parse later
  const val = isCssUnit(v) ? v : `token(spacing.${v}, ${v})`

  // after — answered where it can be answered
  const val = isCssUnit(v) ? v : token(`spacing.${v}`, v)
  ```

  Same semantics: `spacer({ size: '4' })` resolves to `var(--spacing-4)`, `spacer({ size: 'auto' })` to `auto`. The
  build, the extractor and the browser answer identically — the browser through the generated tokens artifact, so it
  cannot disagree with the build about a variable's name.

  **What this buys.** `expand-token-references.ts` was a 180-line character-state parser, and every line of it existed
  for the fallback and its nesting. It is now **22 lines and one regex**. That also closes a live bug for free:
  `token(path)` in a theme or semantic token value was never expanded — it landed in the stylesheet as literal text,
  with no warning — because the parser's shape forced a reference regex that could not see it.

  **Breaking.** A retired form now fails rather than emitting text: in a token value the build stops and names the token
  and its replacement; in a style value it throws where it is used.

  `spacer`, `grid` and `bleed` emit `var(--spacing-4)` where they emitted `token(spacing.4, 4)`, so their declarations
  lose a now-redundant css fallback and the class names derived from those values change. Apps not using those three
  patterns are byte-identical — verified on an example app.

  Cost: a pattern module now imports the generated tokens artifact, shared with any other `token()` use in the app.

### Minor Changes

- 045ab1e: Emit breakpoints and container queries in CSS Media Queries Level 4 range syntax.

  ```diff
  - @media screen and (min-width: 48rem) { … }                              /* md */
  + @media (width >= 48rem) { … }
  - @media screen and (min-width: 48rem) and (max-width: 63.9975rem) { … }  /* mdOnly */
  + @media (width >= 48rem) and (width < 64rem) { … }
  - @media screen and (max-width: 47.9975rem) { … }                         /* mdDown */
  + @media (width < 48rem) { … }
  ```

  The `63.9975rem` was the next breakpoint stepped down by 0.04px, because `max-width` is inclusive and the old syntax
  has no inclusive/exclusive pair. That step cost two things. Viewports inside the 0.04px gap matched neither range —
  small enough to never show up on a device anyone tests on, and real. And stepping down needs arithmetic, so a
  breakpoint in a unit that does not convert to pixels (`vw`, `ch`, a `calc()`) had to be emitted unstepped and
  overlapped its neighbour by a whole unit. An exclusive `<` says the same thing exactly, in any unit, with no
  arithmetic — so both are gone, and the overlap noted in the preceding changeset no longer applies.

  Container queries move to the same construction:

  ```diff
  - @container card (min-width: 40rem) { … }
  + @container card (inline-size >= 40rem) { … }
  ```

  `inline-size` is what a container query is actually asking about — it and `width` diverge the moment a container is in
  a vertical writing mode.

  **What changes for you**
  - **Emitted CSS changes** for every responsive and container style. Class names and hashes are unchanged.
  - **Responsive styles now apply when printing.** `@media screen and (min-width: 48rem)` never matched print;
    `@media (width >= 48rem)` matches it against the page width. Every breakpoint-conditioned declaration now
    participates in print output. If you relied on breakpoints being screen-only, scope those rules with an explicit
    `@media screen` or a `_print` condition.
  - **Browser baseline rises to Chrome 104+, Safari 16.4+, Firefox 102+.** Enabling
    [`lightningcss`](https://bamboocss.com/docs/references/config#lightningcss) lowers these queries against your
    browserslist targets, but only partly recovers the old baseline: the `min` half round-trips to `(min-width: X)`,
    while an exclusive upper bound has no MQ3 spelling and lowers to `not (min-width: Y)` — itself MQ4. So `smDown`,
    `mdOnly`, `mdToXl` and `hideBelow` need roughly Chrome 88 / Safari 14 / Firefox 64 even with lowering on.
  - **`hideBelow` with an arbitrary value is now exclusive.** `hideBelow="800px"` emitted `(max-width: 800px)` and now
    emits `(width < 800px)`, which is what the token form (`hideBelow="md"`) always meant. The two disagreed at exactly
    the bound.
  - **Container rules now sort ahead of every `Down` breakpoint rule, at any width.** Container queries carried no
    readable bound before — their sort key was a bare size like ` 40rem` — so they ranked below anything the sorter
    could classify. They now carry `inline-size >= …` and join the `min` group, which sorts ahead of every `max`-bounded
    rule. Where a container rule and a `Down` breakpoint rule set the same property on the same element, the `Down` rule
    now wins where the container rule used to.
  - **Rules whose media queries tie on computed width may reorder.** Two queries that resolve to the same pixel width
    but are spelled differently — `48rem` against `48em`, or the `md` breakpoint against the `3xl` container size, both
    768px — have no bound to separate them, so the sorter compares the strings. The strings changed, so those ties
    resolve differently.

  **New**

  Container sizes gain the range set breakpoints already had: `@/mdOnly`, `@/mdDown` and `@/mdToXl` alongside `@/md`.
  With the 12 sizes in `preset-bamboo` and one named container this takes the generated container conditions from 24 to
  204, since the `To` spans are quadratic in the size count. That count reaches shipped output: every condition key is
  joined into `css/conditions.mjs` and becomes a member of the generated `Conditions` interface, which
  `ConditionalValue` and `Nested` map over. Trim `theme.containerSizes` if the type surface matters more to you than the
  range keys.

  **Fixed**

  Scale entries are ordered by their converted pixel value rather than their leading digits, so `30rem` no longer sorts
  below `400px`. Ordering only affected the `min` bound before, which is monotonic either way; it decides the upper
  bound of every `Only` and `To` range now, and getting it wrong inverts the range so it matches nothing.
  `validateBreakpoints` rejects a mixed-unit theme, but `theme.containerSizes` has no equivalent check and reaches the
  same code.

### Minor Changes

- 112cb85: Stop a composed custom property inheriting into a descendant that declares its own.

  Registering the transform variables with `@property … { inherits: false }` fixed this for filters and transforms, but
  ten of the variables the preset composes with were left unregistered, so they still inherited. Two of them rendered
  wrong:

  ```tsx
  <div
    className={css({
      bgGradient: 'to-r',
      gradientFrom: 'red.500',
      gradientTo: 'blue.500',
    })}
  >
    <div className={css({ bgGradient: 'to-r' })} />
  </div>
  ```

  The child declares no colours, so it should render nothing. It rendered the parent's gradient, because
  `--gradient-from`/`--gradient-to` reached it by inheritance. The same shape applied to `transition`: a descendant
  using the shorthand inside an element that had set `transitionProperty` or `transitionDuration` silently took that
  element's timing rather than its own defaults.

  Now registered, and a child that declares its own composes only from what it declares:
  - `--gradient-from`, `--gradient-to`, `--gradient-via`, `--gradient-via-stops`
  - `--transition-prop`, `--transition-duration`, `--transition-easing`

  Three more are registered for the same reason but change nothing observable, because every utility that reads them
  also writes them in the same rule: `--gradient-stops`, `--gradient-position`, `--focus-ring-color`.

  None takes an `initialValue`. The gradient colours are read bare rather than with a fallback, on purpose — an unset
  one has to stay guaranteed-invalid so an incomplete gradient drops instead of rendering half of one, which is exactly
  what registration without an initial value gives.

  **Deliberately still inheriting:** `--focus-ring-color-prop`, `--focus-ring-width`, `--focus-ring-style` and
  `--focus-ring-offset`. The utilities that set those emit only a variable and no declaration of their own, so theming a
  subtree's focus rings from an ancestor is the only effect they have; registering them would turn that into dead CSS.
  `--thickness`, `--bleed-x` and `--bleed-y` belong to patterns rather than utilities, and each is written by the same
  transform that reads it, so neither can leak.

  Costs 10 `@property` rules — about 40 bytes gzipped, emitted once.

  Worth checking after upgrading: a nested element that set `bgGradient` or `transition` and happened to render with an
  ancestor's colours or timings now falls back to its own defaults. That was the bug, not a feature — the variables were
  never documented as inheritable and the preset already registered its other composed ones — but it is a visible
  change.

- 7c81ec9: Emit `dropShadow` as a filter function, so it stops invalidating the whole `filter`.

  `dropShadow` passed its value straight through, unlike every other filter utility — `blur` writes `blur(…)`, `sepia`
  writes `sepia(…)`, and so on. So `dropShadow: '0 1px 2px black'` set `--drop-shadow: 0 1px 2px black`, and `filter`,
  which composes nine variables into one declaration, resolved to:

  ```css
  filter: blur(4px) 0 1px 2px black;
  ```

  A filter list is invalid **as a whole** if any function in it is, so this did not merely fail to draw a shadow — it
  dropped every filter on the element, including ones set by a different utility. An element with `blur` and
  `dropShadow` lost its blur too.

  The value is now wrapped: `--drop-shadow: drop-shadow(0 1px 2px black)`. A value that was already written as
  `drop-shadow(…)` — the only form that happened to work before — should now be given without the wrapper.

  Also removed `values: 'dropShadows'` from the utility. `dropShadows` is not a token category: it appears in neither
  `TokenDataTypes` nor the category map in `@bamboocss/token-dictionary`, so nothing ever resolved through it and the
  raw value was emitted. Every filter utility without a token category declares none, which is now true of this one as
  well. The utilities table in the docs listed `dropShadows` as its category and has been corrected.

  Nothing caught either of these because nothing ran the code: `effects.ts` sat at 10% statement coverage, with every
  `transform` body in the untested part, and no test in the repo used `dropShadow`. `filter-utilities.test.ts` now
  asserts that each of the nine filter and nine backdrop-filter utilities contributes something shaped like a filter
  function — with `backdropOpacity`, which takes a bare number, stated as the exception rather than folded in.

- bf2d9c5: Fix `outline: 'none'`, which referenced a token instead of resetting the outline.

  The utility special-cases `none`:

  ```ts
  transform(value) {
    if (value === 'none') return { outline: '2px solid transparent', outlineOffset: '2px' }
    return { outline: value }
  }
  ```

  That branch never ran. `outline` declares `values: 'borders'`, and a utility whose `values` is a token category has
  its value resolved **before** the transform is called — so `value` arrived as `var(--borders-none)` and the comparison
  against `'none'` could not match. No preset defines a `borders.none` token, so the emitted declaration referenced a
  variable that does not exist, which is invalid at computed-value time and dropped. `outline: 'none'` therefore left
  the outline exactly as it was: the opposite of what was asked for, silently.

  The check now reads `raw`, the value as written, and `outline: 'none'` emits `2px solid transparent` with a `2px`
  offset — transparent rather than `none` so the ring survives forced-colors mode, where there is nothing to repaint
  otherwise.

  Three snapshots had recorded the broken output as expected, which is the reason the new tests assert the shape a
  transform is responsible for rather than snapshotting a whole rule.

  The same mistake is not present elsewhere: `float` and `scrollbar` compare against their values too, but their
  `values` is a plain array — an enum of keywords rather than a token category — so nothing is resolved before they see
  it, and `lineClamp` declares no `values` at all. Tests now cover all three alongside the fix.

### Minor Changes

- 355e573: Register composed custom properties with `@property` instead of resetting them on every element.

  Utilities that build one declaration out of several variables — `filter` out of nine, `translate` out of its axes —
  needed the variables nobody set to resolve to something harmless, and needed them not to inherit, since a parent's
  `--blur` reaching its children is a leak rather than a default. Before `@property` the only way to say that was to
  assign all of them a value on `*, ::before, ::after, ::backdrop`, which put 33 custom property declarations on every
  element in the document.

  `inherits: false` says it directly, and the initial value lives in the registration rather than in a declaration per
  element.

  ## `customProperties` on a utility

  A utility now declares the properties it composes, so the guarantee that a variable exists sits with the code that
  reads it:

  ```ts
  filter: {
    className: 'filter',
    values: { auto: 'var(--blur, ) var(--brightness, )' },
    customProperties: {
      '--blur': { syntax: '*', inherits: false },
      '--brightness': { syntax: '*', inherits: false },
    },
  }
  ```

  Registrations are merged across every configured utility, so a reader and a writer may both name the same variable;
  the first declaration wins, so one utility cannot retype a variable another already registered. Third-party presets
  get the behaviour by declaring it next to the utility, with no second list to keep in step.

  Every registration is `syntax: '*'`. A type would let these transition, and would also make a value outside it fail
  silently to the initial value rather than loudly — `translateX: '50%'` under `<length>` renders as `0`. Typing is
  worth doing per variable, where the value space is known, not in bulk.

  Omitting `initialValue` gives a property the guaranteed-invalid value, which is what a `var(--x, )` read expects: the
  reference takes its own empty fallback and composes to nothing. That is what the old `/*-*/ /*-*/` sentinel bought,
  without a declaration per element to buy it.

  ## What changed in the emitted CSS

  The universal rule is gone, replaced by 32 `@property` rules. Against the 33 it declared:
  - **`--rotate`, `--skew-x` and `--skew-y` are no longer declared.** No utility reads or writes them; they were left
    behind by utilities that no longer exist. Stylesheets referencing them directly should set their own.
  - **`--rotate-z` and `--translate-z` are now declared.** `rotate: 'auto-3d'` and `translate: 'auto-3d'` compose them,
    but the reset never covered them — so they inherited, and a parent's value moved or rotated its descendants.

  The three gradient stop positions are now read as `var(--gradient-from-position, )` rather than bare. A stop's
  position is optional, and with no initial value a bare read would take the whole `--gradient-stops` declaration
  invalid at computed-value time and drop the gradient.

  ## Fixes

  `@property` emission no longer falls back to `initial-value: initial` when a definition declares no initial value.
  That keyword is not "no initial value" — under the universal syntax it is a token, so it became the property's value
  and was substituted into whatever composed it, turning `filter: var(--blur, ) …` into `filter: initial …`, which is
  invalid and drops the whole filter. The descriptor is now omitted, which is what the spec asks for.

  Generated types are unchanged: these registrations never reach `globalVars`, so `CssVars` and `CssVarKeys` keep the
  shapes they had. Routing them through `globalVars` would have closed the `CssVars` union to those names and broken
  `var(--anything)` on the ~100 properties whose type union has no string fallback.

### Minor Changes

- f2d5df2: **Breaking:** remove the JSX factory. Bamboo no longer generates components, and is now framework-agnostic.

  `styled-system/jsx` is not emitted at all. `styled` / `bamboo`, style props, the `css` prop, `as`, `unstyled`,
  `createStyleContext`, `splitCssProps` and `isCssProperty` are gone, along with `jsxFramework`, `jsxFactory` and
  `jsxStyleProps`. There is no React, Vue, Solid, Preact or Qwik codegen left anywhere.

  ```tsx
  // before
  <styled.div color="red.300" padding="4">hi</styled.div>
  const Button = styled('button', buttonRecipe)

  // after
  <div className={css({ color: 'red.300', padding: '4' })}>hi</div>
  const Button = (props: ButtonProps) => {
    const [variantProps, rest] = buttonRecipe.splitVariantProps(props)
    return <button {...rest} className={cx(buttonRecipe(variantProps), props.className)} />
  }
  ```

  For an override to be deterministic the component's styles have to sit in a lower cascade layer, which means declaring
  them as a config recipe — an inline `cva()` is atomic and lands in `utilities` alongside the consumer. A component
  that instead accepts a style object and merges it with `css(base, props.css)` needs no layer at all.

  **Recipe JSX tracking is kept**, and no longer depends on `jsxFramework`. A recipe's `jsx: ['Button']` hint is how the
  build reads `<Button variant="danger">` on a component you wrote and emits `--variant_danger`; without it those
  variants would silently stop being generated. It costs no codegen — it is extraction only.

  **`createStyleContext` has no replacement in the box.** Compound components that need one slot to see the variant
  chosen at the root now write their own context; `docs/concepts/slot-recipes` documents the ~20-line version.

  What this removes beyond the API: the whole per-framework generator tree, `is-valid-prop` (a large module that shipped
  to the browser only to decide whether a prop was a style prop), `normalize-html`, the vite fold's JSX element path —
  which has nothing left to fold — and the per-framework test matrix.

  `@bamboocss/plugin-vue` and `@bamboocss/plugin-svelte` are unaffected: they transform source so the extractor can read
  it, which has nothing to do with the factory.

- 1dbeb84: **Breaking:** remove JSX pattern components.

  `styled-system/jsx` no longer emits a component per pattern — `<Stack>`, `<Box>`, `<HStack>` and the rest are gone,
  and `styled-system/jsx` now exports only the factory, `isCssProperty` and `createStyleContext`.

  Pattern **functions** are unchanged. Every pattern still ships from `styled-system/patterns`, and a pattern function
  passes arbitrary style props through, so the rewrite is mechanical and behaviour-preserving:

  ```tsx
  // before
  <Stack gap="4" mt="8">{children}</Stack>
  <Box p="4">{children}</Box>

  // after
  <div className={stack({ gap: '4', mt: '8' })}>{children}</div>
  <div className={css({ p: '4' })}>{children}</div>
  ```

  The `jsx`, `jsxName` and `jsxElement` fields on a pattern config are removed along with them — they only ever
  described a component bamboo generated. `jsx` on a **recipe** is untouched.

  Everything that existed to serve the component layer goes with it: the five per-framework pattern generators, the
  `jsx-patterns` artifact, the parser's `jsx-pattern` result type and `JsxEngine`'s pattern matcher, and the vite fold's
  pattern-element path. `Patterns.find`/`Patterns.filter` (both keyed by JSX name) are gone, and
  `StyleEncoder.processPattern` takes `(name, props, grouped)`.

  Two consequences worth knowing:
  - A component of your own named `Box` or `Stack` is no longer misread as bamboo's pattern. It extracts as an ordinary
    component, which is what it always was.
  - The `jsx-patterns-index` artifact is now `jsx-index`, since it no longer indexes patterns.

  Now it correctly outputs `flex: 0 0 var(--spacing-5, 5)`.

  **Before (broken):** `flex: 0 0 5` — raw value, not a valid CSS length **After (fixed):**
  `flex: 0 0 var(--spacing-5, 5)` — resolved spacing token

### Patch Changes

- ac2fb5c: **Gradient Utilities**: Fixed `token()` and brace syntax not working in `bgGradient`, `bgLinear`, and
  `textGradient` utilities.

  Before this fix, using token references in gradient values would not expand correctly:

  ```jsx
  // ❌ Before: token references were ignored
  css({ bgGradient: 'linear-gradient({colors.red.200}, {colors.blue.300})' })
  // Output: background-image: linear-gradient(var(--gradient-stops))

  // ✅ After: token references are properly expanded
  css({ bgGradient: 'linear-gradient({colors.red.200}, {colors.blue.300})' })
  // Output: background-image: linear-gradient(var(--colors-red-200), var(--colors-blue-300))
  ```

  Both `token()` function syntax and brace syntax `{...}` now work correctly in gradient utilities.

### Minor Changes

- cff19aa: [Breaking] Remove default utility values for `gridTemplateColumns`, `gridTemplateRows`, `gridColumn` and
  `gridRow` to prevent interference with native css values.

  For example `1` or `2` is a valid native value for `gridColumn` or `gridRow`, and should not be overridden by the
  utility.

  Find the previous default values below, you can add them back to your config if you need them.

  ```ts
  const utilities = {
    gridTemplateColumns: {
      className: 'grid-tc',
      group: 'Grid Layout',
      values: {
        '1': 'repeat(1, minmax(0, 1fr))',
        '2': 'repeat(2, minmax(0, 1fr))',
        '3': 'repeat(3, minmax(0, 1fr))',
        '4': 'repeat(4, minmax(0, 1fr))',
        '5': 'repeat(5, minmax(0, 1fr))',
        '6': 'repeat(6, minmax(0, 1fr))',

- df2546a: **BREAKING 💥**

  Remove `linkBox` pattern in favor of using adding `position: relative` when using the `linkOverlay` pattern.

  **Before**

  ```jsx
  import { linkBox, linkOverlay } from 'styled-system/patterns'

  const App = () => {
    return (
      <div className={linkBox()}>
        <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150" alt="placeholder" />
        <a href="#" className={linkOverlay()}>
          Link
        </a>
      </div>
    )
  }
  ```

  **After**

  ```jsx
  import { css } from 'styled-system/css'
  import { linkOverlay } from 'styled-system/patterns'

  const App = () => {
    return (
      <div className={css({ pos: 'relative' })}>
        <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150" alt="placeholder" />
        <a href="#" className={linkOverlay()}>

### Minor Changes

- bcfb5c5: ### Fixed
  - Fix className collisions between utilities by using unique class names per property in the default preset.

  ### Changed
  - **Color Mode Selectors**: Changed the default selectors for `_light` and `_dark` to target parent elements. This
    ensures consistent behavior with using these conditions to style pseudo elements (like `::before` and `::after`).

  ```diff
  const conditions = {
  -  _dark: '&.dark, .dark &',
  +  _dark: '.dark &',
  -  _light: '&.light, .light &',
  +  _light: '.light &',
  }
  ```

  - Changed `divideX` and `divideY` now maps to the `borderWidths` token group.

  ### Added
  - **Spacing Utilities**: Add new `spaceX` and `spaceY` utilities for applying margin between elements. Especially
    useful when applying negative margin to child elements.

  ```tsx
  <div className={flex({ spaceX: '-1' })}>
    <div className={circle({ size: '5', bg: 'red' })} />
    <div className={circle({ size: '5', bg: 'pink' })} />
  </div>
  ```

  - Added new `_starting` condition to support the new `@starting-style` at-rule.
    [Learn more here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@starting-style)
  - **Gradient Position**: Add new `gradientFromPosition` and `gradientToPosition` utilities for controlling the
    position of the gradient color stops.

  ```tsx
  <div
    className={css({
      bgGradient: 'to-r',
      // from
      gradientFrom: 'red',
      gradientFromPosition: 'top left',
      // to
      gradientTo: 'blue',
      gradientToPosition: 'bottom right',
    })}
  />

## 0.29.0

### Minor Changes

- 5fcdeb75: Update every utilities connected to the `colors` tokens in the `@bamboocss/preset-base` (included by
  default) to use the [`color-mix`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/color-mix) CSS
  function.

  This function allows you to mix two colors together, and we use it to change the opacity of a color using the
  `{color}/{opacity}` syntax.

  You can use it like this:

  ```ts
  css({
    bg: 'red.300/40',
    color: 'white',
  })
  ```

  This will generate:

  ```css
  @layer utilities {
    .bg_red\.300\/40 {
      --mix-background: color-mix(in srgb, var(--colors-red-300) 40%, transparent);
      background: var(--mix-background, var(--colors-red-300));
    }

    .text_white {
      color: var(--colors-white);
    }
  }
  ```

  - If you're not using any opacity, the utility will not use `color-mix`
  - The utility will automatically fallback to the original color if the `color-mix` function is not supported by the
    browser.
  - You can use any of the color tokens, and any of the opacity tokens.

  ***

  The `utilities` transform function also receives a new `utils` object that contains the `colorMix` function, so you
  can also use it on your own utilities:

  ```ts
  export default defineConfig({
    utilities: {
      background: {
        shorthand: 'bg',
        className: 'bg',
        values: 'colors',
        transform(value, args) {
          const mix = args.utils.colorMix(value)
          // This can happen if the value format is invalid (e.g. `bg: red.300/invalid` or `bg: red.300//10`)
          if (mix.invalid) return { background: value }

          return {
            background: mix.value,
          }
        },
      },
    },
  })
  ```

  ***

  Here's a cool snippet (that we use internally !) that makes it easier to create a utility transform for a given
  property:

  ```ts
  import type { PropertyTransform } from '@bamboocss/types'

  export const createColorMixTransform =
    (prop: string): PropertyTransform =>
    (value, args) => {
      const mix = args.utils.colorMix(value)
      if (mix.invalid) return { [prop]: value }

      const cssVar = '--mix-' + prop

      return {
        [cssVar]: mix.value,
        [prop]: `var(${cssVar}, ${mix.color})`,
      }
    }
  ```

  then the same utility transform as above can be written like this:

  ```ts
  export default defineConfig({
    utilities: {
      background: {
        shorthand: "bg",
        className: "bg",
        values: "colors",
        transform: createColorMixTransform("background"),
    },
  });
  ```

- 250b4d11: ### Container Query Theme

  Improve support for CSS container queries by adding a new `containerNames` and `containerSizes` theme options.

  You can new define container names and sizes in your theme configuration and use them in your styles.

  ```ts
  export default defineConfig({
    // ...
    theme: {
      extend: {
        containerNames: ['sidebar', 'content'],
        containerSizes: {
          xs: '40em',
          sm: '60em',
          md: '80em',
        },
      },
    },
  })
  ```

  The default container sizes in the `@bamboocss/preset-bamboo` preset are shown below:

  ```ts
  export const containerSizes = {
    xs: '320px',
    sm: '384px',
    md: '448px',
    lg: '512px',
    xl: '576px',
    '2xl': '672px',
    '3xl': '768px',
    '4xl': '896px',
    '5xl': '1024px',
    '6xl': '1152px',
    '7xl': '1280px',
    '8xl': '1440px',
  }
  ```

  Then use them in your styles by referencing using `@<container-name>/<container-size>` syntax:

  > The default container syntax is `@/<container-size>`.

  ```ts
  import { css } from "/styled-system/css";

  function Demo() {
    return (
      <nav className={css({ containerType: "inline-size" })}>
        <div
          className={css({
            fontSize: { "@/sm": "md" },
          })}
        />
      </nav>
    );
  }
  ```

  This will generate the following CSS:

  ```css
  .cq-type_inline-size {
    container-type: inline-size;
  }

  @container (min-width: 60em) {
    .\@\/sm:fs_md {
      container-type: inline-size;
    }
  }
  ```

  ### Container Query Pattern

  To make it easier to use container queries, we've added a new `cq` pattern to `@bamboocss/preset-base`.

  ```ts
  import { cq } from "styled-system/patterns";

  function Demo() {
    return (
      <nav className={cq()}>
        <div
          className={css({
            fontSize: { base: "lg", "@/sm": "md" },
          })}
        />
      </nav>
    );
  }
  ```

  You can also named container queries:

  ```ts
  import { cq } from "styled-system/patterns";

  function Demo() {
    return (
      <nav className={cq({ name: "sidebar" })}>
        <div
          className={css({
            fontSize: { base: "lg", "@sidebar/sm": "md" },
          })}
        />
      </nav>
    );
  }
  ```

- f778d3e5: Updated the default preset in Bamboo to use the new `defaultValues` feature.

  To override the default values, consider using the `extend` pattern.

  ```js
  defineConfig({
    patterns: {
      extend: {
        stack: {
          defaultValues: { gap: '20px' },
        },
      },
    },
  })
  ```

### Minor Changes

- 84304901: Improve performance, mostly for the CSS generation by removing a lot of `postcss` usage (and plugins).

  ## Public changes:
  - Introduce a new `config.lightningcss` option to use `lightningcss` (currently disabled by default) instead of
    `postcss`.
  - Add a new `config.browserslist` option to configure the browserslist used by `lightningcss`.
  - Add a `--lightningcss` flag to the `bamboo` and `bamboo cssgen` command to use `lightningcss` instead of `postcss`
    for this run.

  ## Internal changes:
  - `markImportant` fn from JS instead of walking through postcss AST nodes
  - use a fork of `stitches` `stringify` function instead of `postcss-css-in-js` to write the CSS string from a JS
    object
  - only compute once `TokenDictionary` properties
  - refactor `serializeStyle` to use the same code path as the rest of the pipeline with `StyleEncoder` / `StyleDecoder`
    and rename it to `transformStyles` to better convey what it does

- bee3ec85: Add support for aspect ratio tokens in the bamboo config or preset. Aspect ratio tokens are used to define
  the aspect ratio of an element.

  ```js
  export default defineConfig({
    // ...
    theme: {
      extend: {
        // add aspect ratio tokens
        tokens: {
          aspectRatios: {
            '1:1': '1',
            '16:9': '16/9',
          },
        },
      },
    },
  })
  ```

  Here's what the default aspect ratio tokens in the base preset looks like:

  ```json
  {
    "square": { "value": "1 / 1" },
    "landscape": { "value": "4 / 3" },
    "portrait": { "value": "3 / 4" },
    "wide": { "value": "16 / 9" },
    "ultrawide": { "value": "18 / 5" },
    "golden": { "value": "1.618 / 1" }
  }
  ```

  **Breaking Change**

  The built-in token values has been removed from the `aspectRatio` utility to the `@bamboocss/preset-base` as a token.

  For most users, this change should be a drop-in replacement. However, if you used a custom preset in the config, you
  might need to update it to include the new aspect ratio tokens.

  <div className={grid({ minChildWidth: '80px', gap: 8 })} />
  // ✅ grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(80px, 1fr))

  <div className={grid({ minChildWidth: '20', gap: 8 })} />
  // ❌ grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(20, 1fr))
  //                                                  ^^^
  ```

  After:

  ```tsx
  <div className={grid({ minChildWidth: '80px', gap: 8 })} />
  // ✅ grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(80px, 1fr))

  <div className={grid({ minChildWidth: '20', gap: 8 })} />
  // ✅ grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(var(--sizes-20, 20), 1fr))
  //                                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

### Minor Changes

- 811f4fb1: Add new visually hidden and bleed patterns.

  ### Bleed

  Bleed is a layout pattern is used to negate the padding applied to a parent container. You can apply an `inline` or
  `block` bleed to a child element, setting its value to match the parent's padding.

  ```tsx
  import { css } from '../styled-system/css'
  import { bleed } from '../styled-system/patterns'

  export function Page() {
    return (
      <div class={css({ px: '6' })}>
        <div class={bleed({ inline: '6' })}>Welcome</div>
      </div>
    )
  }
  ```

  ### Visually Hidden

  Visually hidden is a layout pattern used to hide content visually, but still make it available to screen readers.

  ```tsx
  import { css } from '../styled-system/css'
  import { visuallyHidden } from '../styled-system/patterns'

  export function Checkbox() {
    return (
      <label>
        <input type="checkbox" class={visuallyHidden()}>
          I'm hidde
        </input>
        <span>Checkbox</span>
      </label>
    )
  }
  ```

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- c08de87f: ### Breaking
  - Renamed the `name` property of a config recipe to `className`. This is to ensure API consistency and express the
    intent of the property more clearly.

  ```diff
  export const buttonRecipe = defineRecipe({
  -  name: 'button',
  +  className: 'button',
    // ...
  })
  ```

  - Renamed the `jsx` property of a pattern to `jsxName`.

  ```diff
  const hstack = definePattern({
  -  jsx: 'HStack',
  +  jsxName: 'HStack',
    // ...
  })
  ```

  ### Feature

  Update the `jsx` property to be used for advanced tracking of custom pattern components.

  ```jsx
  import { Circle } from 'styled-system/jsx'
  const CustomCircle = ({ children, ...props }) => {
    return <Circle {...props}>{children}</Circle>
  }
  ```

  To track the `CustomCircle` component, you can now use the `jsx` property.

  ```js
  import { defineConfig } from '@bamboocss/dev'

  export default defineConfig({
    patterns: {
      extend: {
        circle: {
          jsx: ['CustomCircle'],
        },
      },
    },
  })
  ```

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 60a77841: Refactor `transition` utility to improve DX of adding transition. Transitions will now add a default
  transition property, timing function and duration. This allows you to add transitions with a single property.

  ```jsx
  <div className={css({ transition: 'background' })}>Content</div>
  ```

  This will generate the following css:

  ```css
  .transition_background {
    transition-property: background, background-color;
    transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
    transition-duration: 150ms;
  }
