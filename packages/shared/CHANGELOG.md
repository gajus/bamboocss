### Minor Changes

- 950df68: Fail the build when two declarations hash to the same class name, instead of shipping both.

  Class names go through a 32-bit hash rendered into letters, so distinct declarations can land on the same name.
  Nothing noticed. The stylesheet emitted two rules under one selector:

  ```css
  .bRzHLW {
    transition: 192009px;
  }
  .bRzHLW {
    width: 114360px;
  }
  ```

  and both `css()` calls compiled to that same literal, so every element carrying it received a declaration its source
  never mentions. Exit code 0, no warning — and undiagnosable from the symptom, which is a component styled by a
  property that appears nowhere in its source.

  The odds are per build and grow with the square of the atom count. Measured: the 6,254 distinct declarations in one
  production sheet produce none, and a synthetic 100,000-atom set produces one, matching the birthday prediction —
  roughly 0.5% at 6,000 atoms, 5% at 20,000, 25% at 50,000. Rare enough never to have been reported, common enough to be
  someone's afternoon.

  Now it throws, naming both declarations rather than only the class they share. That is what this codebase already does
  everywhere a name is derived twice and the two halves only meet in the DOM — see `checkNamingAgreement`, whose
  reasoning is the same: failing now costs a build, not failing ships the wrong styles.

  Only reachable under `hash: true`. Readable class names carry the declaration that produced them, so they are unique
  by construction and are unaffected.

  `toHash` itself is untouched and stays a pure, self-contained expression — `generateCva` and `generateRecipe`
  serialize it into the styled-system runtime, so anything it closed over would be a free variable in the browser. The
  check is a separate build-time step at the two sites that assign a name.

### Minor Changes

- 5c33622: `strictTokens` is now `strictValues`, and it is a build check.

  Two things were wrong with it as a set of TypeScript narrowings, and both are about the same confusion — it was
  answering a _policy_ question with a _correctness_ mechanism.

  **A utility's values replaced the property's own.** `transitionProperty` declares the sugar `common`, `colors`,
  `size`, `position` and `background`, so the setting rejected `transitionProperty: 'color'` — a real CSS property name,
  and a `<custom-ident>` exactly where the grammar asks for one — and suggested `'colors'`, which emits seven
  declarations instead of one. A utility adds vocabulary to a property; it does not take the property's own away.
  Nothing narrows now, so a property always keeps its own values:

  ```ts
  // styled-system/types/style-props.d.ts
  transitionProperty?: ConditionalValue<UtilityValues['transitionProperty'] | CssVars | CssProperties['transitionProperty'] | AnyString>
  ```

  **It could not tell a keyword from a raw value.** `display: 'flex'` is not reaching outside the design system — `flex`
  is the only way to say it — so the old setting handled `display` by not narrowing it at all, which let
  `display: 'abc'` through with it. The grammar draws that line:

  ```ts
  css({ color: 'red.300' }) //               ✅ a token
  css({ display: 'flex' }) //                ✅ a keyword
  css({ animationName: 'fadeIn' }) //        ✅ an identifier you invented
  css({ transitionProperty: 'color' }) //    ✅ a css property name

  css({ fontSize: '14px' }) //               ❌ write `[14px]`
  css({ color: '#fff' }) //                  ❌
  css({ border: '1px solid red' }) //        ❌
  ```

  It reads the styles your **source** produced, so a preset's reset and your own config recipes are not held to a policy
  about your source — which is why it is a separate pass rather than a branch in the resolver, which sees both. Graded
  by `validation`: a warning by default, and a failure under `validation: 'error'`.

  **Migration.** Rename `strictTokens` to `strictValues` in your config, and `--strict-tokens` to `--strict-values`. The
  setting means what `true` always meant; there is no type-level version of it any more, so the errors move from `tsc`
  to the build.

  Together with removing the middle mode, this takes the whole type-level narrowing out. Measured on this repo's
  documentation site with `tsc --extendedDiagnostics` — deterministic counts, not wall clock — **Types 40,995 → 18,320
  and Instantiations 181,030 → 46,230.**

### Patch Changes

- 4734709: Stop failing an SSR build for not emitting a stylesheet it is not supposed to emit.

  `build.ssrEmitAssets` is off by default, so Vite discards CSS assets from an SSR build — the client build is what
  carries the sheet. A server bundle that imports `virtual:bamboo.css` from shared code, which a root component or a
  layout does, therefore asked this plugin to load the stylesheet and then emitted nothing, and the guard against a
  vanished stylesheet read that as the failure it exists to catch.

  It failed a build that was entirely correct. Qwik's `vite build --ssr` is the shape that showed it: every call
  compiled, the client bundle carrying the stylesheet, and the server bundle refusing to finish. React Router escapes it
  only because its plugin turns `ssrEmitAssets` on. The guard still applies wherever assets are emitted, including an
  SSR build that asks for them.

  Separately, `truncateList` reads `BAMBOO_DIAGNOSTIC_LIMIT` off `globalThis` rather than through a bare `process`. The
  value was already guarded, but the _name_ still had to exist: an app type-checking its own source without
  `@types/node` — every Vite template — failed on this file for naming a global it has never heard of, which is what a
  `tsc` step in two of this repo's own sandboxes was doing.

### Patch Changes

- eb3025a: Report a surviving recipe reference where it actually is, and make diagnostic truncation raisable.
  - **`runtime-binding` pointed at the wrong file and an impossible line.** The surviving reference is found through the
    project-wide symbol graph, so it is usually in a module other than the one being folded. Its offsets index that file
    and were reported against the folded one, which produced a line number derived from text that does not contain it —
    `app/styles.ts:841` on a file with fewer lines than that. The reference's own file and line are now carried and
    reported, so the message names the call site that has to change rather than the declaration.
  - **`BAMBOO_DIAGNOSTIC_LIMIT` raises the findings cap**, or set it to `all` for every one. A capped list is right for
    reading one failure and wrong for scoping a migration: "… and 13 more files" left no way to drive the list to zero
    except by fixing what was shown and rebuilding to reveal the next batch. It overrides a caller's explicit limit too,
    and a malformed value falls back to the default rather than replacing the diagnostic with a complaint about the
    variable.
  - **The unimported-stylesheet error now says the import has to be JavaScript.** `@import 'virtual:bamboo.css'` from a
    stylesheet fails as an unresolvable path, because Vite resolves CSS `@import` before plugin resolution. The previous
    wording sent people to try it.
  - **Documented what actually decides whether an inline recipe compiles**: every reference to the binding has to be a
    compiled call. Neither the declaring module nor a runtime variant selection is what fails — reading the binding
    itself is, since the declaration is erased.

### Minor Changes

- c49ab36: Cap the diagnostic lists, and group a dead call by the binding rather than by the file.

  A build error's job is to name the mistake, and every list in one was joined whole. A pattern dropped from a preset
  and called across an app produced **400 identical blocks and 1,221 lines of stderr** carrying one line of information,
  with the paragraph explaining the failure scrolled off the top. The same error is now six lines:

  ```txt
  ERR_BAMBOO_DEAD_IMPORT: 400 call(s) name a binding that does not exist:

  `stack` is not a pattern — `../styled-system/patterns` does not export it.
    400 file(s): src/comp-0.tsx, src/comp-1.tsx, src/comp-10.tsx, src/comp-100.tsx, src/comp-101.tsx, … and 395 more

  Both entrypoints are generated from your config, so what they export moves when it does — …
  ```

  Grouping is by the binding because that is the unit of the mistake; two distinct dead bindings stay two findings.
  Files within a group are deduplicated, since one module can call the same one twice.

  The other three unbounded lists are capped rather than grouped, each carrying a distinct message with nothing to
  collapse: files that could not be extracted, unresolved token values (25, being one line each), and the
  `failOnUnfolded` survivor list. In every case the count is of what was withheld, and a list that fits is joined
  exactly as before.

  `truncateList` and `groupBy` are exported from `@bamboocss/shared`.

- c527ea7: Fail the build on a call to a binding the pattern or recipe entrypoint no longer exports.

  ```
  error: 1 call(s) name a binding that does not exist:

  src/modal.tsx
    `stack` is not a pattern — `../styled-system/patterns` does not export it.

  Both entrypoints are generated from your config, so what they export moves when it does — a pattern
  dropped from a preset, a recipe renamed. The call survives that as a binding to nothing: nothing
  extracts it, so every rule it would have contributed is absent from the stylesheet and the classes
  their components ask for have nothing behind them.
  ```

  Both entrypoints are generated from the config, so what they export moves when it does. The import survives that as a
  binding to nothing — `isValidPattern` declines it, so it never reaches `patternAliases`, `matchFn` declines every call
  of it, and the extractor records nothing. The call site is still there and still asks for a class.

  Removing one pattern took eleven selectors out of a release this way, along with every modal's spacing and width.
  Codegen printed four ticks and exited 0; it was found by diffing selector sets before and after. That is the outcome
  `assertExtracted` already fails on, reached from the other direction, so it now reports the same way — every file
  named in one pass, dropped once the file is fixed, deleted, or leaves `include`, and surviving the incremental passes
  that skip an unchanged file.

  **Reported per call, not per import.** Both entrypoints export types beside their functions — `FlexProperties` from
  `patterns`, `ButtonVariantProps` from `recipes` — and neither is a pattern or a recipe, so an import-only test reports
  every file that types a prop. TypeScript lets those be written without the `type` keyword and elides them either way,
  so the keyword is not a filter this can rely on. A type is never called, which is. A binding nobody calls is left
  alone for the same reason: nothing asked it for a class, so no rule is missing.

  Not governed by a severity option, unlike `unresolvedToken`. That one infers a mistake from a value's shape and can be
  wrong about a literal; this is read off the entrypoint's own export list.

## 1.33.0

## 1.32.0

### Minor Changes

- c29044f: Fail the build when a file cannot be extracted, instead of logging it and exiting 0.

  ```
  error during build:
  [bamboocss:css] Could not load virtual:bamboo.css: 1 file(s) could not be extracted:

  src/Timeline.tsx
    `{colors.brand.purple/35}` in the value `0 0 0 2px {colors.brand.purple/35}` is the retired
    token reference syntax. Write `token(colors.brand.purple/35)` instead.

  Nothing emits a rule for a file the build could not read, so every style in these is absent from
  the stylesheet and the classes their components ask for have nothing behind them.
  ```

  Extraction caught, logged, and carried on. The file's styles never reach the encoder, so every rule it would have
  contributed is simply gone — one retired token spelling in one component dropped that component's css and left a green
  build behind it. Three error-level lines, exit 0, and `built` printed at the end.

  **The two integrations disagreed about the same source.** `bamboo cssgen` exited 1 on a file it could not extract,
  because it went through the one entry point that let the throw out; every bundler build went through the one that
  caught it. CI running a build passed what CI running `cssgen` rejected. Both now go through the same path, so the
  question is settled once rather than per integration.

  Every broken file is named in one error rather than the first one aborting the pass, and a failure is keyed by file so
  it survives the incremental passes that skip an unchanged one — otherwise a rebuild of identical, still-broken source
  came back green. It is dropped once the file parses, is deleted, or leaves `include`, since a context outlives
  rebuilds and all three of those are fixes. A watch rebuild still reports and keeps watching; only a build fails.

  **`failOnUnfolded` counts a module the fold threw on.** A throw in the vite transform was caught and the module
  returned unchanged, which is safe — its runtime call still works — but it landed in neither the folded column nor the
  declined one. The coverage summary reported 100% over the files that did not throw, and the survivor check saw a file
  that was never there, so the option's whole guarantee held vacuously over it. It now reports as `fold-failed`. Unknown
  counts as survives: the claim is that _nothing_ still calls `css()`, and a module nobody could look at cannot support
  it. Without `failOnUnfolded` it stays a logged error and a declined module, as before.

- 8a66bb9: Remove the responsive array syntax, so a responsive value has one spelling.

  `fontWeight: ['medium', undefined, undefined, 'bold']` used to mean one value per breakpoint. Write the condition
  object instead:

  ```ts
  css({ fontWeight: { base: 'medium', lg: 'bold' } })
  ```

  The array form was the worse of the two on its own terms — positional, so skipping a breakpoint needed `undefined`
  padding, and inserting a breakpoint re-pointed every value after it. But the reason it had to go is that CSS already
  writes lists as arrays, so a font stack written the obvious way

  ```ts
  css({ fontFamily: ['Inter', 'sans-serif'] })
  ```

  compiled to `Inter` at base and `sans-serif` at `sm`, with no error and nothing in the type to suggest it.

  An array in a style value is now an error naming the property it was written on, rather than a silent
  reinterpretation. The type no longer admits one either: `ConditionalValue` drops its array member, and `CssProperties`
  is built from csstype's `Properties` rather than `PropertiesFallback` — that array meant repeated declarations, which
  `fallback()` already expresses and which the runtime never implemented.

  A pattern property takes the same conditional value, so `grid({ columns: [2, 3, 4] })` becomes
  `grid({ columns: { base: 2, sm: 3, md: 4 } })`.

  The generated runtime no longer carries the breakpoint key list into `css`, `cva` and `mergeCss` — it existed only to
  expand these arrays.

- 2b84dfa: Remove the array argument from `css()` and `css.raw()`, leaving one way to pass a list of styles.

  `css([a, b])` meant `css(a, b)` — the runtime flattened one level before merging. Spread instead, which is what you
  already write when the operands are named:

  ```ts
  css(...styles) // was css(styles)
  css(a, b) //      was css([a, b])
  ```

  The declared type also carried the single-object overload twice, verbatim, so the emitted `styled-system/css/css.d.ts`
  advertised four signatures where the variadic one covers every call. It is now one:

  ```ts
  (...styles: Styles[]): string
  ```

  An array argument throws rather than being ignored, at build time where the file is known and at runtime otherwise.
  That matters more than it sounds: an array and a style object disagree about what indices mean. The parser flattened
  one before encoding precisely because hashing it instead read `[{ color }, { padding }]` as a responsive array and
  emitted the padding at the `sm` breakpoint — and merely dropping the flatten would have returned no class at all,
  silently.

  Removing it also takes the `flat()` out of every merge and the `some(Array.isArray)` scan out of every extracted
  `css()` call, both of which every call paid to serve a shape that was never documented.

## 1.31.0

### Minor Changes

- 9c32b00: Narrow `styled-system/css` to the authoring API.

  The barrel was four `export *` lines, so every binding its modules happened to export became part of the public API.
  Seven were plumbing:

  ```text
  what `import { … } from 'styled-system/css'` offered before:

    css, css.raw, cx, cva, sva, fallback, viewTransition, auditSlotScopes
    cssLeaf, cvaPick, splitProps           <- written by the source transform, never by hand
    mergeCss, assignCss, mergeCssUncached  <- internal merge plumbing
  ```

  The barrel is now a deliberate list. `cssLeaf`, `cvaPick` and `splitProps` are still exported at runtime — the fold
  adds them to whatever `styled-system/css` import a file already has, so that is the specifier its emitted calls
  resolve against — but the declaration file omits them. Folded code is rewritten in memory during the bundler's
  transform and never typechecked, so a declaration bought nothing beyond an autocomplete entry advertising them as API.
  Each stays typed in the module that defines it.

  **`mergeCss` and `mergeCssUncached` leave the barrel.** They remain at `styled-system/css/merge-css`, which is where
  `cva` imports them from. `css.raw(...)` is the authoring API for merging style objects and always was the documented
  one: it is `mergeCss` plus the clone that makes a shared, memoized result safe to hand back, so the uncloned function
  beside it was a footgun under a second name.

  **`assignCss` is removed.** It had no callers — not in the runtime, the artifacts, the sandboxes or the docs — and no
  documented purpose.

  The runtime/declaration split was already there and pointing the other way: `css.mjs` re-exported the merge trio while
  `css.d.ts` never declared it, so `mergeCss` was importable but untyped through the barrel. That is now consistent.

  A test pins the half that nothing else could catch. The barrel is a hand-written list, the emitted calls are never
  typechecked, and a bundler only _warns_ about an import naming a missing export — so dropping `cvaPick` from the list
  would leave the fold emitting calls that silently receive `undefined`. The test asserts every name the fold can inject
  is exported by the barrel's runtime, and that none of them is declared in its types.

- 678bdee: Remove `token(path, fallback)`. A token is referenced one way: `token(path)`.

  The fallback bundled two unrelated behaviours under one spelling — "resolve this, or use the literal if it names no
  token", answered at build time, and "emit `var(--x, fallback)`", answered by the browser. The call site could not say
  which it was getting, and the build-time half silently masked a typo'd path, which is the same reason the `fallback`
  argument was removed from `token.value()`.

  **Patterns resolve tokens directly now.** `PatternHelpers` gains `token(path, fallback)`:

  ```ts
  // before — deferred into a string for the css pipeline to parse later
  const val = isCssUnit(v) ? v : `token(spacing.${v}, ${v})`

  // after — answered where it can be answered
  const val = isCssUnit(v) ? v : token(`spacing.${v}`, v)
  ```

  Same semantics: `spacer({ size: '4' })` resolves to `var(--spacing-4)`, `spacer({ size: 'auto' })` to `auto`. The
  build, the extractor and the browser answer identically — the browser through the generated tokens artifact, so it
  cannot disagree with the build about a variable's name.

  **What this buys.** `expand-token-references.ts` was a 180-line character-state parser, and every line of it existed
  for the fallback and its nesting. It is now **22 lines and one regex**. That also closes a live bug for free:
  `token(path)` in a theme or semantic token value was never expanded — it landed in the stylesheet as literal text,
  with no warning — because the parser's shape forced a reference regex that could not see it.

  **Breaking.** A retired form now fails rather than emitting text: in a token value the build stops and names the token
  and its replacement; in a style value it throws where it is used.

  `spacer`, `grid` and `bleed` emit `var(--spacing-4)` where they emitted `token(spacing.4, 4)`, so their declarations
  lose a now-redundant css fallback and the class names derived from those values change. Apps not using those three
  patterns are byte-identical — verified on an example app.

  Cost: a pattern module now imports the generated tokens artifact, shared with any other `token()` use in the app.

## 1.30.1

## 1.30.0

### Patch Changes

- 242b24c: `pruneUnusedTokens: 'strict'` now fails the build on a reference it cannot resolve, instead of warning.

  `strict` is an assertion — you are stating that every token path in the project resolves at build time. When that
  turned out to be false it printed a warning and quietly kept every token declaration, which leaves you believing the
  layer was pruned when it was not. That is the same silence the flag exists to remove.

  Only that one fails. Everything else is **reported** and keeps the layer exactly as the default would — a `.vue` or
  `.svelte` component stored post-transform, a file it could not parse, a barrel it cannot classify, a dynamic
  `import()`. Those reasons exist because declining used to be free, so the accounting declined anything it could not
  prove; several of them have nothing to do with tokens, and failing a build over a route-splitting `import()` would be
  indefensible.

  A failed _rebuild_ now reports itself too. A throw inside a watch callback was discarded by the file watcher, surfaced
  as an internal `Unhandled rejection`, left the exit code at 0, and was invisible at `logLevel: 'silent'`.

  The error is `TOKEN_REFERENCE_UNRESOLVED`, and names every unresolved reference with its file and line.

### Patch Changes

- 087b884: Lower inline recipe calls the build cannot resolve, so the recipe config leaves the bundle.

  `badge({ tone })` where `tone` is a prop or state used to keep the whole recipe. Every class it can produce is
  knowable — only _which one_ applies is not — so what ships is the choice:

  ```ts
  // you write
  const badge = cva({ base: { rounded: 'full' }, variants: { tone: { info: {…}, warn: {…} } } })
  const cls = badge({ tone })

  // the bundle gets
  const cls = 'cva_1a2b3c' + cvaPick(tone, { info: ' cva_1a2b3c--tone_info', warn: ' cva_1a2b3c--tone_warn' })
  ```

  `cvaPick` is a new export of the generated `cx` module — chosen because it pulls no engine — and is about 45 bytes. A
  recipe's classes are **additive**, one per variant, so N runtime axes lower to N terms rather than to every
  combination of their values.

  **Measured end to end**, bundling a module with one dynamic recipe call:

  |        | minified  | gzipped   |
  | ------ | --------- | --------- |
  | before | 10,347 B  | 4,034 B   |
  | after  | **139 B** | **150 B** |

  **The saving is the config, and it needs `/*#__PURE__*/` to happen at all.** `cva({ base, variants })` ships the whole
  style object so the runtime can hash it into a name — but those styles are already in the stylesheet. Once every call
  of a binding lowers, nothing reads it; a bundler still will not drop `cva(…)`, because it cannot prove the call is
  side-effect free, so the build now annotates it. Without that annotation folding made modules **larger**: 10,347 →
  10,447 B, classes added and nothing removed. The annotation is only emitted when every call of that binding lowered —
  while one survives, the binding is still read.

  Across an application with 1,271 inline recipe bindings, **1,024 lower completely**, freeing 62 kB gzipped of config
  against 17 kB of added call sites.

  **What still declines,** reported as `recipe-call`: a spread or computed key, whose selection cannot be enumerated; a
  selection that could _run_ something, since folding deletes the argument; a config the build could not read; and slot
  recipes, which resolve to one class per slot rather than a string.

  **Classes are emitted in the config's variant order**, which is the order the runtime appends them — so a folded
  module and a dev build produce the same `class` attribute rather than the same set in a different order.

  `getRecipeClassNames` now looks variant values up as own keys. A value of `'toString'` or `'constructor'` previously
  found `Object.prototype`'s member, passed the null check and named a class no rule backs; both sides now agree it
  selects nothing.

## 1.22.0

### Minor Changes

- a1062c9: Remove `cssMode: 'grouped'`.

  **This is a breaking change released as a minor.** Bamboo is still pre-1.0 in practice, so the version does not carry
  the signal — read the migration below before upgrading. A config setting `cssMode` will fail to typecheck, and
  `bamboocss()` from `@bamboocss/vite` now returns an array of plugins rather than one.

  Use `cva({ base: { ... } })` where you want one class per element instead of one per property. It already does exactly
  that, and it does it better.

  **Why**

  Measured on a production build of a real app — the same source built both ways:

  |           |   CSS raw | CSS gzip |
  | --------- | --------: | -------: |
  | `atomic`  | 1,411,989 |  209,489 |
  | `grouped` | 2,913,254 |  390,428 |

  **+86% gzipped**, entirely in the `utilities` layer, which goes from 673 kB to 2.17 MB. Grouping pays only where a
  style set lands on many elements; it groups every `css()` call, and most of them are one-offs where a group is one
  rule serving one element with nothing to amortise it against.

  The markup saving cannot repay that. Across eight routes of the same app, grouping saved 1.9 bytes of gzipped markup
  per element rendered — so roughly **95,000 elements** have to render before the stylesheet's extra 181 kB is earned
  back, about 112 page views with a warm cache. The documentation claimed the trade favoured SSR and SSG; the app
  measured here is server-rendered and never comes close.

  **What to use instead**

  A variant-less `cva` emits a single class carrying every declaration:

  ```ts
  const row = cva({
    base: { display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', gap: '4' },
  })
  // .cva_gphwnw { display: flex; align-items: center; gap: var(--spacing-4) }
  ```

  It lands in the `recipes` layer rather than `utilities`, which is the part `cssMode` got wrong. Because
  `@layer reset, base, tokens, recipes, utilities` puts `utilities` last, a consumer's `css()` override beats it
  deterministically in every build — where a grouped `css()` class sat in `utilities` alongside the atoms it competed
  with, leaving conflicts to source order.

  The rule of thumb is the useful part: **if a style set is worth grouping, it is worth naming.** Grouping pays when a
  set is reused, and a reused set is a component.

  **Also removed**
  - `RuleProcessor.grouped()` and the `GroupedRule` type.
  - `groupClassName` from `@bamboocss/shared`, and the `grouped` / `knownGroups` fields on `CreateCssContext`.
  - The generated `groups` artifact (`styled-system/css/groups.mjs`) — delete it if a stale copy is left in your output
    directory.
  - The `'ambiguous-merge'` and `'too-many-combinations'` unresolved-style reasons, which only ever applied to grouping,
    and the `'grouped'` value of `UnresolvedStyle['kind']`.

  `css()` calls the build cannot fully read are still reported, unchanged: a spread or computed key warns with a file
  and line, because it looks static and is not.

## 1.21.0

### Patch Changes

- 81f8789: Stop a single `css([...])` or pattern call from deoptimizing every later `css()` call in the process.

  `flatHashOrNull` in `memo.ts` hashed an array argument with a marker and then fell through to the same `for...in` loop
  it uses for plain objects. That loop and its `obj[k]` read are the hottest sites in the file, and V8 specializes them
  against the element kinds they have seen. Once an array reached them the specialization widened and never narrowed
  again — and because `memo` is shared by every memoized function in the runtime (`css`, `cva`, the patterns), the cost
  landed on all of them, process-wide, permanently, including on instances built afterwards.

  Arrays now take the string key instead. Correctness never depended on the fall-through: an array reaching there holds
  style objects, so the `typeof v === 'object'` check returned `null` on its first element anyway. Keeping the shape out
  of the loop is the whole change.

  **What it cost.** Measured on the flat `css()` case, 10k calls per iteration:

  ```
  objects only                             0.80ms
  objects and arrays interleaved           7.02ms   <- before
  objects only, after an array was seen    6.74ms   <- and it never recovered
  ```

  Any app calling both `css({...})` and `css([...])` — or any pattern, which merges through the same path — was paying
  roughly 8x on every call. An app that only ever passed a plain object was unaffected, which is why this survived: the
  benchmarks measured that state, and the deoptimizing bench sat next to them in the same file.

  **After**, on the same benches (`packages/generator/__tests__/css-fn.bench.ts`, 10k calls per iteration):

  | bench                       | before    | after     |
  | --------------------------- | --------- | --------- |
  | `pattern stack()`           | 4.3141 ms | 0.6533 ms |
  | `high-cardinality css()`    | 21.264 ms | 11.361 ms |
  | `composed css([a, [b, c]])` | 2.9576 ms | 2.3802 ms |
  | `inline css()`              | 0.7336 ms | 0.8250 ms |

  Patterns gain the most because they pass arrays through the merge on every call. `inline css()` is unchanged within
  noise — it is the case that was already monomorphic.

  CSS output is byte-identical; this changes only how the runtime caches. Verified by rebuilding a real project's
  stylesheet and diffing against the pre-fix build.

  **A benchmark that reported the opposite.** The same deopt is why `css-fn.bench.ts` reported `cssMode: 'grouped'` as
  9.4x slower than atomic on the cached path. `grouped inline css()` ran after `composed css([a, [b, c]])` and inherited
  the deoptimized runtime; atomic measured after that same bench read 6.72ms too. The two are at parity — 0.85ms against
  0.83ms — and the file now warms every argument shape up front so a reintroduced deopt shows up everywhere at once
  instead of only after whichever bench first passes an array.

### Patch Changes

- 10d7c9b: Fix an inline `cva`/`sva` losing every style when a declaration has no value.

  The same divergence as the whitespace fix, reached a second way. Extraction drops a nullish declaration, so

  ```ts
  cva({ base: { color: undefined, padding: '4' } })
  ```

  is recorded as `{ base: { padding: '4' } }` and the stylesheet emits a rule under that name. The browser hashes the
  config as authored, keeps the `color` key, and derives a different name — so the element carries a class no rule
  matches and renders with **none** of the recipe's styles. `null` behaves the same way.

  Reaching it does not take anything exotic: a placeholder left in place, or spreading an object that happens to hold an
  undefined value.

  The identity now omits nullish declarations before hashing, matching what the build records. Build-side names are
  unchanged, so no emitted CSS moves; only the browser's derivation moves onto them. A config whose `base` is entirely
  nullish now hashes as an empty one, which is what the build already emitted for it.

  Found by comparing the two derivations directly across a spread of value shapes, which is now a test —
  `recipe-identity-agreement.test.ts` parses each shape as a real file and checks the extracted config and the authored
  one hash alike. It covers numbers, floats, negatives, template literals, escape sequences, empty strings, booleans,
  responsive arrays including one with a hole, deeply nested conditions, numeric variant keys, and nullish declarations
  nested inside variants and compound variants.

  That file exists because `checkNamingAgreement` structurally cannot cover this: it compares the two derivations for
  one fixed canary, so it sees divergence in the shared naming logic and nothing about how a particular call site was
  written. Both bugs of this shape were invisible to it.

- aa0f641: Fix an inline `cva`/`sva` losing every style when a declaration value contains repeated whitespace.

  An inline recipe's classes are named from a hash of its config, derived independently by the build and by the browser.
  The build never sees the config as written: `maybe-box-node` reads every string literal through `trimWhitespace`, so
  `'calc(100vh -  16px)'` is `'calc(100vh - 16px)'` by the time it reaches the encoder. The browser holds it as
  authored.

  The two therefore hashed different objects and derived different names, so the element carried a class the stylesheet
  had no rule for and rendered with **none** of the recipe's styles. Nothing warned.

  ```ts
  cva({ base: { minHeight: 'calc(100vh -  16px)' } }) // build: cva_fepkUe, browser: cva_kOwuny
  cva({ base: { color: 'rgba(0,  0, 0, 0.5)' } }) // build: cva_idlHhr, browser: cva_gCkUyn
  cva({ base: { padding: '12px  16px' } }) // build: cva_jkWnrH, browser: cva_cINWCv
  ```

  The identity now collapses whitespace in string values before hashing, with `trimWhitespace`'s own regex rather than a
  second spelling of it. Two configs differing only in repeated whitespace produce identical CSS and now share a name,
  which is what the stylesheet already assumed — the build emits one rule for both.

  **No emitted CSS changes.** Every build-side name is what it was; only the browser's derivation moves onto it.

  Worth knowing about the failure mode, because it defeats the obvious checks: the orphaned name leaves no unused rule
  behind. A config that collapses onto an existing one is byte-identical to it, so the stylesheet has exactly the rules
  it should and only the _runtime_ asks for something absent. Diffing the stylesheet, or looking for dead rules, finds
  nothing.

  `checkNamingAgreement` did not catch it either, and still would not: it compares the two derivations for a fixed
  canary, which cannot see a divergence introduced by how a particular call site was written. Setting `className` on the
  recipe remains an effective workaround for any such divergence, since the identity then short-circuits on the name and
  never hashes the config at all.

- 0e2cb31: Stop breakpoints in an unrecognised unit being read as pixels.

  `getUnit` matched anywhere in a string and only in lower case, and the conversions ran `parseFloat` over the raw
  value. `parseFloat` returns a number for plenty of strings that are not a pixel count, so a unit the conversion did
  not recognise was silently treated as one. Two ways to reach it, both producing valid CSS that matches the wrong
  viewports or none:

  | breakpoints        | `mdOnly` emitted                               | should be                                        |
  | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
  | `50EM`             | `(min-width: 40EM) and (max-width: 3.1225rem)` | `(min-width: 40rem) and (max-width: 49.9975rem)` |
  | `calc(40em + 0px)` | `(min-width: NaNrem)`                          | the value, unchanged                             |
  | `50vw`             | `(max-width: 3.1225rem)`                       | `(max-width: 50vw)`                              |

  `40EM` is as valid as `40em`; CSS units are case-insensitive. Reading it as `40px` made the range sixteen times too
  small, so `min-width: 640px` and `max-width: 50px` matched nothing at all. `validateBreakpoints` did not catch any of
  it, because it asked the same function and fell back to `px` for whatever came back empty — a theme written entirely
  in `EM`, or mixing `em` with `vw`, passed the same-unit check.

  Now:
  - Unit matching is anchored and case-insensitive, so a unit inside a larger expression is not mistaken for the value's
    own, and `40EM` converts exactly as `40em` does. The number accepts what CSS accepts, including `.5rem` and `1e3px`.
  - The numeric half is read from the match rather than by `parseFloat` over the raw string, so a value that is not a
    number and a unit is passed through untouched instead of becoming `NaN`.
  - Breakpoint arithmetic only steps a value down when it is in a unit that converts to pixels. Anything else — `vw`,
    `ch`, a `calc()` — is emitted as written. That costs an overlap of one unit between adjacent ranges, against a range
    that previously matched nothing. (Superseded in the same release: range syntax removed the step entirely, so these
    units no longer overlap either.)
  - `validateBreakpoints` reads the unit generically, so it can tell `em` from `EM` from `vw` and its same-unit check
    works for units bamboo does not convert.

  `unit-conversion.ts` had no test file. It has one now, along with breakpoint cases for each shape above.

## 1.19.0

## 1.18.0

### Minor Changes

- 21c6daa: Drop the class-name cache under `css()`'s own memo.

  `createCss` returned `memo(...)`, so the generated `css()` carried two caches in a row:

  ```js
  css = memo((...styles) => cssFn(mergeCssUncached(...styles)))
  ```

  `cssFn` is reached only when the outer memo missed, and the merged object it receives is a deterministic function of
  the same arguments — so the second cache cannot hit. Instrumented over 25k calls it served zero hits in every
  workload, including working sets past `MAX_ENTRIES`, where both caches rotate in lockstep rather than one rescuing the
  other. This is the same redundancy already removed for the merge, one layer down.

  A new `createCssUncached` export carries the uncached form, and `createCss` keeps the cache. That split matters: the
  vite fold reaches `createCss` directly with no memo above it, and the merge feeding it is many-to-one there, so it
  hits 2-35% across real projects — removing its cache outright measured +187% on the fold. The generated `css()` and
  the generated recipe runtime both take the uncached form, the latter because it constructs one _inside_ a memoized
  function, where the cache is built per call and used once.

  Measured on the generated runtime, isolated against the merge change that preceded it:

  | shape            | before | after  | delta  |
  | ---------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
  | flat miss        | 1425ns | 1113ns | −21.9% |
  | conditional miss | 1956ns | 1601ns | −18.1% |
  | realistic miss   | 2706ns | 2371ns | −12.4% |
  | hit (control)    | 85ns   | 88ns   | noise  |

  Class names are unchanged; the hit path is untouched. `packages/shared/__tests__/memo.test.ts` counts the reads rather
  than timing them, so the guard holds on any machine.

  `createRuntimeCss` in `@bamboocss/vite` now genuinely mirrors the shape its own comment described — one memo on the
  argument list, neither inner cache — which is 37-51% faster on every fold workload measured.

## 1.17.3

## 1.17.2

## 1.17.1

### Patch Changes

- fc381ca: Terminate hex escapes in class selectors, so a digit-led class name still matches its element.

  A CSS escape consumes up to **six** hex digits, then one optional whitespace that ends it. `esc` emitted the escape
  without that terminator, so whenever the character after it was itself a hex digit it was read as part of the escape:

  | class name | selector emitted | the browser reads |
  | ---------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
  | `640:p_4`  | `\3640\:p_4`     | `㙀:p_4`          |
  | `3d:p_4`   | `\33d\:p_4`      | `̽:p_4`            |
  | `12:p_4`   | `\312\:p_4`      | `̒:p_4`            |
  | `0a`       | `\30a`           | `̊`                |

  The element's `class` attribute still said `640:p_4`, so the selector matched nothing and it rendered unstyled — with
  no error, and invisible to any check that escapes both sides through this same function.

  Stock breakpoints escape their leading digit too and were unaffected only by luck: `2xl:bg_red` becomes `\32xl…`, and
  `x` is not a hex digit, so the escape ended where it should. Reaching the bug takes a breakpoint or condition named
  numerically (`640`, `12`) or as a digit followed by `a`–`f` (`3d`), or any digit-led class name whose next character
  is a hex digit.

  The terminator is now emitted, matching `CSS.escape` and the `jQuery.escapeSelector` this came from. A parser consumes
  the space as part of the escape, so it never reads as a descendant combinator, and escapes that already worked keep
  their meaning — `\30\.5` becomes `\30 \.5`, and both are `0.5`.

  `esc.test.ts` compared against recorded strings, which cannot tell a correct escape from one that names a different
  character, and had pinned `\30a` as expected output. It now also decodes each result the way a parser does and asserts
  the round trip.

## 1.17.0

### Patch Changes

- 3cdd0d1: Stop `css()` paying for a second cache keyed on the arguments it just hashed.

  The generated runtime was `css = memo((...styles) => cssFn(mergeCss(...styles)))`, and `mergeCss` is itself memoized
  on its argument list. So a `css()` call consulted two caches keyed on the same thing — and the second one could never
  answer. Reaching the merge at all means the outer cache missed, and a miss means those exact arguments have not been
  seen, so the inner lookup is _guaranteed_ to miss too. The redundancy is structural, not a matter of hit rate.

  Measured over 25,000 `css()` calls across four distinct styles, the inner memo served **zero** hits while paying a
  hash, a bucket scan, a snapshot and an insert on each of the four misses. Driven directly with no memo above it, the
  same function hit 24,996 times — which is why it stays memoized for the callers that reach it that way.

  `createMergeCss` now also returns `mergeCssUncached`, the same merge without the cache, and the generated `css` calls
  that instead. `css.raw`, `cva` and the Vite fold's runtime keep the memoized one: none of them sits behind a memo
  keyed on the same arguments, so for them the cache is doing real work.

  The win is on the miss path, which is where dynamic styles and SSR live. Cached calls are unchanged:

  | bench                            | before  | after   |              |
  | -------------------------------- | ------- | ------- | ------------ |
  | high-cardinality `css()`         | 26.48ms | 19.73ms | −25.5%       |
  | high-cardinality grouped `css()` | 28.23ms | 21.53ms | −23.7%       |
  | inline `css()` (cached)          | 0.724ms | 0.689ms | −4.8%, noise |
  | multi-arg `css(a, b)` (cached)   | 0.758ms | 0.767ms | +1.2%, noise |
  | `stack()` pattern (cached)       | 4.223ms | 4.246ms | +0.5%, noise |

  Per 10k iterations, interleaved new/old/new, controls read in every run.

  Locked down by counting rather than timing, per the note in `CLAUDE.md`: an enumerable getter on the style object is
  read once per pass over the arguments, so `packages/shared/__tests__/memo.test.ts` now asserts a miss costs four reads
  (hash, snapshot, and the merge itself) rather than six. Reintroducing the inner memo fails that test with
  `expected 6 to be 4`.

- d5347ab: Four fixes found by auditing the recipe work for edge cases. Three are silent failures of the same shape: a
  class name derived one way for the stylesheet and another way for the browser.

  **The fold emitted broken JavaScript for a property access on `css()` or a pattern.** Folding a slot access widened
  the replaced range to cover the member expression — but the widening applied to every foldable call, so the property
  read was deleted:

  ```js
  css({ color: 'red' }).trim() // → "c_red"()          TypeError
  flex({ direction: 'row' }).split(' ') // → "d_flex flex-d_row"(' ')
  ```

  It now fires only for a recipe whose accessed property names a slot the recipe declares.

  **Every compound variant was dead under `hash: true` or `prefix`.** A compound's selector is assembled from class
  names, and it was assembled from raw ones while the element carried prefixed or hashed ones — so
  `.btn--size_sm.btn--tone_a` selected nothing while the element carried `bam-btn--size_sm bam-btn--tone_a`. The
  selector is now built through the same `formatSelector` as every other class.

  **A compound variant on a scoped slot recipe matched nothing at all.** A scoped slot carries only its constant class,
  so a compound selecting on that slot's variant classes can never apply. It is now scoped by the anchor, like the
  variants it refines:

  ```css
  @scope (.cmp__root--size_lg.cmp__root--tone_a) to (.cmp__root) { .cmp__item { … } }
  ```

  **Two slot recipes differing only in `slots` or `scopeRoots` collided.** `getRecipeIdentity` hashed only the style
  fields, so "same styles, different DOM topology" — exactly what `scopeRoots` exists for — produced one name. An inline
  recipe is registered once, so whichever was extracted first decided the emission for both and the other rendered
  unstyled. Both fields now count toward the identity, which changes the generated name of every anonymous `sva`.

  **An `sva` that omits `slots` rendered unstyled.** The build infers slots and the runtime does not, so once `slots`
  counted toward the identity the two sides derived different names. The identity is now hashed from the config as
  written — what both sides actually see — and `checkNamingAgreement` gained a canary that leaves `slots` out, so it
  cannot recur.

  **`auditSlotScopes` was a no-op under `hash` or `prefix`.** It builds its selectors from `classNameMap`, and an inline
  `sva` populated that map with raw names while returning formatted ones — so the diagnostic went silent in precisely
  the configs where a naming bug is likeliest. Config slot recipes were already correct; the two now agree.

- c6154dc: Give `splitProps` a path for the shape it is actually called with.

  Every call site in the project passes one array group — a recipe's `variantKeys` — and it runs per component per
  render, inside `splitVariantProps`. The general implementation is built for several groups that may be predicates, and
  paid for that shape on every call: a closure per group, a `map` and a `concat` to assemble the result, and a branch
  per group to tell an array from a predicate. None of it is reachable with one array group.

  How much this wins depends on what the framework hands over, so both ends are worth naming:

  | props                      | before    | after |                     |
  | -------------------------- | --------- | ----- | ------------------- |
  | plain data, 2 variant keys | 650ns     | 395ns | −39%                |
  | plain data, 8 variant keys | 709ns     | 440ns | −38%                |
  | a non-enumerable key       | 915ns     | 662ns | −28%                |
  | accessors or a proxy       | 2.3–4.9µs |       | ~0–9%, within noise |

  Plain objects are what React and Vue pass. Solid passes a `mergeProps` proxy, where a trap per key dominates
  everything around it — the saving is real there but small, because trap cost is not what this path skips. The general
  path is unchanged to within its control (+0.0%).

  Worth saying what it does _not_ skip, because both look skippable and neither is:
  - The `own` set stays. Membership has to be answered from `ownKeys` rather than by asking the object: on a proxy —
    which is what Solid's `mergeProps` hands over — every question is a trap, and a recipe naming eight variants would
    otherwise fire eight traps to learn what one `ownKeys` already said.
  - The two passes stay separate. The group bucket is in _group_ order and the rest bucket in _props_ order, and that
    ordering reaches the emitted CSS.

  Skipping either is where the bigger numbers come from, and both change behaviour. Reading `props[key]` instead of its
  descriptor is faster still and is the change that broke Solid once already.

  The per-key descriptor rules are now one function shared by both paths, rather than two copies to keep in step, and a
  differential test pins the two paths against each other over the shapes that distinguish them.

## 1.16.1

## 1.16.0

### Minor Changes

- 091f2e1: **Breaking:** an inline `cva()`/`sva()` now emits the same kind of CSS as a recipe declared in
  `theme.recipes` — one class per variant, in the `recipes` cascade layer — instead of atomic classes in `utilities`.

  An inline recipe and a config recipe were the same declaration, evaluated by the same code, that produced different
  naming, a different layer and different override behaviour. Nothing about the two justified that: a config recipe is
  an inline one that happens to be declared somewhere with a name.

  ```js
  cva({
    base: { padding: '4' },
    variants: { size: { sm: { fontSize: 'sm' } } },
  })
  // before: 'p_4'                    in @layer utilities
  // now:    'cva_a1b2c3'             in @layer recipes
  //         'cva_a1b2c3--size_sm'    when size="sm"
  ```

  Three things follow.

  **A component written with `cva` is now reliably overridable.** Its classes are in `recipes`, so a consumer's `css()`
  in `utilities` wins by cascade layer in every build, without the consumer knowing how the component was declared. That
  was previously true only if you hoisted the styles into `theme.recipes`.

  **`cssMode: 'grouped'` no longer has an exception.** Recipes were extracted atomically whatever `cssMode` said,
  because a group class names a whole call and which variant combination a caller selects is not knowable at build time.
  That forced a second `css` instance — the internal `__atomicCss` — purely so their runtime could name classes the way
  the stylesheet did. Naming from the config is knowable in every mode, so `__atomicCss` is gone and `cva` no longer
  sprays atomic classes into grouped markup.

  **Compound variants are a compound selector.** `.btn--size_sm.btn--tone_a` rather than atomic classes joined at
  runtime, which puts them in the same layer as the rest of the recipe and leaves the runtime nothing to compute — the
  rule matches because both variant classes are already on the element.

  ### Naming

  The class prefix is derived from the config: `className` when you set one, otherwise a hash of the recipe's styles.

  ```js
  cva({ className: 'button', base: { padding: '4' } }) // .button, .button--size_sm
  cva({ base: { padding: '4' } }) //                      .cva_a1b2c3, .cva_a1b2c3--size_sm
  ```

  It has to come from the config because the build and the browser each derive it independently and never meet. Deriving
  it from the binding — `const button = cva(...)` — would need the build to rewrite the call, and a pipeline without
  that transform would then name classes differently from one with it.

  ### Faster at runtime

  Naming from the config means the runtime no longer resolves a style object to produce a class string. `cva()` used to
  run `mergeCss` per active variant and then name a class per property; it now walks the variant keys and concatenates.

  Measured with both shapes in one process, so the comparison cannot drift
  (`packages/generator/__tests__/cva.bench.ts`):

  ```
  cva() all-miss x10000   173.72 hz ±2.23%   (semantic)
                           33.38 hz ±0.91%   (the atomic shape this replaced)   → 5.2x
  cva() warm x10000      1,678    hz ±0.60%  (semantic)
                         1,720    hz ±0.51%  (atomic)                           → within noise
  ```

  All-miss is every call selecting a distinct variant combination, so nothing is reusable. Warm, both return from the
  memo without doing the work that distinguishes them, which is why they match. `raw()` is unchanged — it still resolves
  styles, because that is what it returns.

  ### The trade

  CSS grows. Two recipes that both set `padding: 4` no longer share one atomic rule, and a variant that repeats a
  declaration repeats it in each rule. In exchange the markup shrinks — a component carrying a recipe goes from a class
  per property to its base class plus one per active variant, which in this repo's own fixtures is 23 classes down to 2.

  ### Also fixed

  Two naming bugs that predate this change and affected config recipes too, both found by extending
  `checkNamingAgreement` to cover recipes:
  - A variant value containing a space named `--size-x\ large` in the stylesheet and `--size-x_large` in the browser.
    The build now applies `withoutSpace`, as the runtime always has.
  - Under `hash: true` the build reported a recipe's **base** class unhashed while emitting the rule under the hashed
    name, so `@bamboocss/vite` could fold a class literal no rule existed for.

  ### Upgrading

  Class names change for every `cva`/`sva` call site, so DOM snapshots and any CSS that targeted the generated atomic
  classes will need updating. Styles themselves are unchanged. If you were relying on a `cva` losing to a `css()` by
  stylesheet order, it now wins or loses by layer instead — which is the point, but it is a change in behaviour.

- f2d5df2: **Breaking:** remove the JSX factory. Bamboo no longer generates components, and is now framework-agnostic.

  `styled-system/jsx` is not emitted at all. `styled` / `bamboo`, style props, the `css` prop, `as`, `unstyled`,
  `createStyleContext`, `splitCssProps` and `isCssProperty` are gone, along with `jsxFramework`, `jsxFactory` and
  `jsxStyleProps`. There is no React, Vue, Solid, Preact or Qwik codegen left anywhere.

  ```tsx
  // before
  <styled.div color="red.300" padding="4">hi</styled.div>
  const Button = styled('button', buttonRecipe)

  // after
  <div className={css({ color: 'red.300', padding: '4' })}>hi</div>
  const Button = (props: ButtonProps) => {
    const [variantProps, rest] = buttonRecipe.splitVariantProps(props)
    return <button {...rest} className={cx(buttonRecipe(variantProps), props.className)} />
  }
  ```

  For an override to be deterministic the component's styles have to sit in a lower cascade layer, which means declaring
  them as a config recipe — an inline `cva()` is atomic and lands in `utilities` alongside the consumer. A component
  that instead accepts a style object and merges it with `css(base, props.css)` needs no layer at all.

  **Recipe JSX tracking is kept**, and no longer depends on `jsxFramework`. A recipe's `jsx: ['Button']` hint is how the
  build reads `<Button variant="danger">` on a component you wrote and emits `--variant_danger`; without it those
  variants would silently stop being generated. It costs no codegen — it is extraction only.

  **`createStyleContext` has no replacement in the box.** Compound components that need one slot to see the variant
  chosen at the root now write their own context; `docs/concepts/slot-recipes` documents the ~20-line version.

  What this removes beyond the API: the whole per-framework generator tree, `is-valid-prop` (a large module that shipped
  to the browser only to decide whether a prop was a style prop), `normalize-html`, the vite fold's JSX element path —
  which has nothing left to fold — and the per-framework test matrix.

  `@bamboocss/plugin-vue` and `@bamboocss/plugin-svelte` are unaffected: they transform source so the extractor can read
  it, which has nothing to do with the factory.

- d7226f0: **Breaking:** remove template literal syntax.

  The `syntax` config option is gone, along with the `--syntax` CLI flag and the syntax question `bamboo init -i` asked.
  Styles are written as objects.

  A project that set `syntax: 'template-literal'` now gets a TypeScript error on the option, and its tagged templates
  are no longer read by the extractor — `` css`color: red;` `` and `` styled.div`color: red;` `` produce no CSS. Convert
  them to object literals:

  ```tsx
  // before
  const One = styled.div`
    display: flex;
    width: 300px;
  `

  // after
  const One = styled('div', {
    base: {
      display: 'flex',
      width: '300px',
    },
  })
  ```

  Everything the option gated goes with it: the string-literal `css`/`conditions` runtimes and the string-literal JSX
  factories and types for all five frameworks, the parser's tagged-template branch, the extractor's `taggedTemplates`
  matcher, the vite fold's tagged-template path, and `astish` from `@bamboocss/shared`. Under the object syntax `cva`,
  `sva`, patterns, `is-valid-prop`, style props and `viewTransition()` were already the only paths taken, so their
  generated output is unchanged — the codegen artifacts are byte-identical.

### Patch Changes

- 645bb09: Stop `cssMode: 'grouped'` rendering an element with no styles when the build could not see the whole `css()`
  call.

  A grouped class names a whole call, so the build has to have seen that exact call to emit its rule. When it had not —
  an unresolvable value, a combination it declined to enumerate — the runtime returned a class with nothing behind it
  and the element rendered blank. Not a degraded version of the styles: none of them.

  Three pieces, and the feature needs all three:
  - The build writes the set of grouped classes it emitted to `styled-system/css/groups.mjs`, refreshed after every
    extraction — including `--watch`, which reaches CSS emission through a path of its own. `codegen` seeds an empty one
    when the file is missing, so the import resolves on a fresh project, and leaves a populated one alone rather than
    blanking it.
  - The generated `css()` consults it. A class in the set is returned alone, as before. A class that is not keeps the
    group class and **adds** atomic names for each declaration.
  - A call the build flagged as unresolvable now contributes atomic rules as well as its group, so those names have
    somewhere to land. Gated on the call actually being at risk, so the duplication is bounded by unresolvable call
    sites rather than by stylesheet size.

  Adding to the group class rather than replacing it is what makes a stale registry harmless: it lags the stylesheet as
  a matter of when files land, and replacing would turn every lag into an element stripped of styles it really had. A
  wrong miss now costs one class that matches nothing. Only a false _hit_ can hurt, which is why the registry is an
  exact set and not a probabilistic one.

  A value the build never saw still has no rule under any mode — the same limit `atomic` has. What changes is that the
  declarations it _did_ resolve now apply.

- 645bb09: Fix `cssMode: 'grouped'` combined with `hash: true` rendering every element unstyled.

  A grouped class names a whole `css()` call, so the build and the runtime each derive it from the same group id. They
  derived it independently, and only the build routed the result through `formatSelector` — which hashes again when
  `hash.className` is set. The build emitted `.cYeKWS` while the runtime asked for `bKFMNe`, so every rule in the
  stylesheet missed and no element carrying a grouped class had any styles at all.

  A group id already digests every declaration in the call, so it is now hashed exactly once. `hash.className` shortens
  _utility_ class names, which a grouped class is not.

  The derivation moved into a single `groupClassName` helper in `@bamboocss/shared` that both sides call, so the two
  cannot name the class differently again — the next naming-relevant option cannot reintroduce this on one side only.

  Only `grouped` + `hash` changes. Grouped without hashing, with or without a `prefix`, emits byte-identical CSS:
  `formatSelector` reduced to `formatClassName` for an empty condition list, which is exactly what the helper does.

- 645bb09: Add `knownGroups` to `createCss`, so a grouped call the build never saw can fall back to atomic class names
  instead of returning a class with no rule behind it.

  Grouping names a class after a whole `css()` call, which means the build has to have seen that exact call to emit its
  rule. When it has not — a value it could not resolve, a combination it declined to enumerate — the element renders
  with **no** styles rather than losing a single declaration.

  Given the set of group classes the build actually emitted, the runtime now notices the miss and names each declaration
  atomically instead. That is not a complete recovery: an atomic class only helps where a rule for it exists. But it
  degrades to the partial styling `cssMode: 'atomic'` would have produced, rather than to nothing.

  The fallback shares its naming with the atomic branch, so a group that misses is named exactly as `cssMode: 'atomic'`
  would have named the same object — two spellings could drift, and the fallback would then reach for rules the
  stylesheet does not carry. Declarations are collected during the existing walk but not transformed until a miss
  actually happens, so a hit costs a set lookup rather than the naming work it avoids.

  Omitting `knownGroups` leaves the runtime exactly as it was, at no cost. Membership must be exact: a probabilistic
  structure trades a false positive for size, and a false positive here returns a class with no rule — the failure this
  exists to remove.

- 645bb09: Fail the build when the stylesheet and the runtime would disagree on class names.

  A class name is derived twice — once by `StyleDecoder` on the way into the stylesheet, and once by `css()` in the
  browser — and the two only ever meet in the DOM. When they disagree there is no error and no warning: the rule is
  emitted, the class is returned, and every element carrying it renders with no styles at all. That is how
  `cssMode: 'grouped'` combined with `hash: true` shipped broken.

  `checkNamingAgreement` now runs once per build, against the config actually being built. It sends a canary style
  object through both paths and compares the class names, raising `ERR_BAMBOO_NAMING_DISAGREEMENT` with both sets when
  they differ.

  Running it against the real config matters because the naming inputs are open-ended: the `utility:created` hook can
  replace `toHash` outright, and `separator`, `prefix` and custom utilities all feed the same derivation. A test can
  only pin the combinations it enumerates.

  The check runs on cloned encoder and decoder, so the canary never reaches the stylesheet being emitted.

## 1.15.0

### Minor Changes

- 3014989: Add `viewTransition()` to `styled-system/css`.

  It styles the [View Transitions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API) and
  returns one class for the bag:

  ```js
  import { viewTransition } from '../styled-system/css'

  const slide = viewTransition({
    group: { animationDuration: '0.4s' },
    imagePair: { isolation: 'isolate' },
    old: { animationName: 'slide-out' },
    new: { animationName: 'slide-in' },
  })
  // → 'vt_bxRGKd'
  ```

  ```css
  .vt_bxRGKd {
    view-transition-class: vt_bxRGKd;
  }
  ::view-transition-group(.vt_bxRGKd) {
    animation-duration: 0.4s;
  }
  ::view-transition-image-pair(.vt_bxRGKd) {
    isolation: isolate;
  }
  ::view-transition-old(.vt_bxRGKd) {
    animation-name: slide-out;
  }
  ::view-transition-new(.vt_bxRGKd) {
    animation-name: slide-in;
  }
  ```

  The class carries `view-transition-class`, not `view-transition-name`. A name has to be unique per element, so it
  cannot be shared, extracted or deduplicated — you still set that yourself. A class is shared by design, which is what
  lets one transition be emitted once and used anywhere.

  The four slots — `group`, `imagePair`, `old`, `new` — are ordinary style objects, so tokens, breakpoints and at-rule
  conditions resolve inside them. Rules land in the `utilities` layer, so a keyframe or token reached only from a
  transition is still seen by `pruneUnusedKeyframes` and `pruneUnusedTokens`.

  The class is a hash of the options with object keys sorted, so slot order and property order do not affect it, and
  keys that are not slots are ignored. A nullish slot is the same as an absent one, matching what the extractor can see.
  The build and the generated runtime call the same function to derive the class, so a call the extractor never saw
  still returns the class its CSS was written against.

  Aliased (`import { viewTransition as vt }`) and namespaced (`import * as bamboo`) imports are extracted. A project's
  own local `viewTransition`, or a recipe or pattern of that name, is left alone. Not extracted or generated for
  `template-literal` syntax.

  Two limits worth knowing, both documented: one class covers all four slots, so a value that cannot be resolved at
  build time costs the whole bag its CSS rather than one declaration; and conditions that lower to a selector (`_hover`,
  `_dark`) cannot reach a `::view-transition-*` pseudo-element, so only at-rule conditions apply inside a slot.

  No existing CSS output changes — nothing is emitted unless `viewTransition()` is called.

## 1.14.0

### Minor Changes

- b567114: Drop `@bamboocss/studio` and `@bamboocss/astro-plugin-studio`.

  Studio was the visual token browser inherited from Panda — an Astro site that read your config and rendered your
  colors, typography and spacing. It is no longer maintained, and both packages are removed from the repository. The
  versions already on npm stay there and keep working; they will not receive further releases.

  **`bamboo studio` is gone.** Its own flags — `--build`, `--preview`, `--port`, `--host`, `--outdir` and `--base` —
  have no replacement. If you have it in a `package.json` script, remove the script.

  **`config.studio` is gone**, along with the `StudioOptions` type. Leaving `studio: { logo, outdir, inject }` in a
  config is now a TypeScript error rather than a silent no-op, so delete it — a plain-JS config will keep ignoring it.
  `Context.studio` is removed from `@bamboocss/core`, and the `MISSING_STUDIO` error code from `@bamboocss/shared`'s
  `BambooErrorCode` union.

  The studio output directory is no longer written to `.gitignore` by `bamboo init`. Existing `.gitignore` files keep
  their `styled-system-studio` line until you remove it, which is harmless — nothing writes there anymore.

  For documenting a design system, [spec files](/docs/theming/spec) generate a machine-readable description of your
  tokens, recipes and patterns that you can render however you like, and the [MCP server](/docs/ai/mcp-server) exposes
  the same information to AI tooling.

- d1d05fc: Add `fallback(...)` for progressive-enhancement values.

  CSS expresses a value fallback by declaring the same property more than once — the browser keeps the last declaration
  it can parse. A style object cannot hold the same key twice, so there was no way to write one. `fallback(...)` closes
  that gap:

  ```js
  css({ height: 'fallback(calc(100dvh - 100px), calc(100vh - 100px))' })
  ```

  ```css
  .h_fallback\(calc\(100dvh_-_100px\)\,_calc\(100vh_-_100px\)\) {
    height: calc(100vh - 100px);
    height: calc(100dvh - 100px);
  }
  ```

  Candidates are written most-preferred first and emitted in reverse. Each one resolves like an ordinary value, so
  tokens, the `[...]` escape hatch and shorthand properties all work inside a fallback, as do conditions, breakpoints,
  `globalCss`, recipes, patterns and JSX style props. `!important` marks every candidate. Under `strictTokens`,
  `fallback(...)` is accepted alongside the other escape hatches, though the candidates inside it are not individually
  checked — the same trade-off the `[...]` escape hatch already makes.

  Only a value that is _entirely_ one `fallback(...)` call is treated as a candidate list —
  `1px solid fallback(red, blue)` is left alone.

  Every candidate has to resolve to exactly one declaration, because that is all the cascade arbitrates between. A
  candidate that expands further — `transitionProperty` emits a `--transition-prop` variable beside the property,
  `lineClamp` emits four declarations for a number and one for `none`, `divideX` emits a nested rule — would leave those
  extras applying unconditionally whichever candidate the browser took. Those warn and apply the preferred candidate
  alone.

  Malformed calls warn and drop the declaration rather than emitting text that is not CSS: an unbalanced `(` or `[`, and
  a `fallback(...)` nested inside another. A misspelled name or one embedded in a larger value (`calc(fallback(a, b))`)
  is an ordinary string that Bamboo cannot recognise, and reaches the stylesheet verbatim.

  Reach for it when the fallback is a different design decision rather than a polyfill. If you use LightningCSS, it
  already generates vendor-prefix and color-space fallbacks from your browser targets, and it prunes the ones your
  targets don't need — including candidates you write yourself.

## 1.13.2

### Patch Changes

- 79c9872: Assemble class names without the throwaway arrays.

  Every style leaf of every `css()` cache miss built an array for the prefix, filtered it and joined it — and most
  configs set no prefix, so that array only ever held the class it started with. Conditions were spread into a second
  array and joined even when there were none.
  - A flat `css()` cache miss end to end: **1710 → 1443 ns** (-15.6%)
  - One with conditions and a responsive value: **2675 → 2589 ns** (-3.2%)
  - Measured on the assembly alone, with the memo forced to miss: **+25%** flat, **+10%** with a condition, **+14%**
    with a condition and a prefix
  - Class names are unchanged across a 27,000-object corpus, and across 43,008 combinations of prefix, class, condition
    and hashing

  The prefix is now read once when the `css` function is built rather than per leaf. It is set in the `Utility`
  constructor and the `utility:created` hook can only replace `toHash`, so there is nothing to re-read.

- 61fe88c: Answer "is this style object empty" without building the compacted object.

  `mergeCss` discards style objects that hold nothing once undefined values are dropped, and it decided that by
  compacting the object, taking a key array for the result, and throwing both away. It only ever needed to know whether
  one defined value existed.
  - The predicate itself: **19x** on a three-key style object, **43x** on a twenty-key one
  - A flat `css()` cache miss end to end: **2030 → 1857 ns** (-8.5%); the nested case moves within noise
  - Class names are unchanged across a 27,000-object corpus

  The predicate is the same one: `Object.keys` enumerates exactly what `compact`'s `Object.entries` did, so own,
  enumerable and string-keyed still decide it, and `null` still counts as present where `undefined` does not.

- be3764d: Skip the per-leaf string rewrites that have nothing to rewrite.

  `sanitize`, `isImportant`, `withoutImportant` and `withoutSpace` run on every style leaf of every `css()` cache miss,
  and each one starts with a regex rewrite. For the values that dominate real style objects — `red`, `4px`, `lg` — all
  four are no-ops. Each now begins with the cheapest search that can prove there is nothing to do.
  - A flat `css()` cache miss: **2474 → 2027 ns** (-18%)
  - One with conditions and a responsive value: **3040 → 2808 ns** (-7.6%)
  - Class names are unchanged across a 27,000-object corpus covering conditions, responsive arrays, `!important`, and
    values carrying whitespace

  The guards are exact rather than approximate, which is the only thing making them safe: `/\s/` is precisely the class
  the collapse matched, `trim()` strips precisely that set again, and `/\s*!(important)?/` cannot match a string with no
  `!`.

  `withoutImportant` and `withoutSpace` now declare `string | T` instead of inferring it. They return a rewritten
  string, so inferring `T` would have promised callers back the literal they passed in.

- 7a63215: Stop rebuilding style objects that are already normal.

  Normalizing renames a shorthand to its longhand, expands a responsive array into a breakpoint object, and drops
  nullish leaves. A flat object of plain values written in longhand needs none of the three — which is most of what
  `css()` is handed — but it was still walked and rebuilt, with a path array allocated per key.
  - Normalizing a flat object, measured through `mergeCss`: **-22% to -26%**, and **-28%** for one carrying twenty
    properties
  - A flat `css()` cache miss end to end: **1825 → 1685 ns** (-7.7%)
  - Class names are unchanged across a 27,000-object corpus

  An object that does need normalizing pays for the check that found out, which measures between +2% and +7% depending
  on how late the first dirty key appears. The nested case is around -4% overall, since the same objects tend to have
  flat blocks inside them.

  The result may now be the argument itself rather than a fresh object, so callers have to treat it as read-only. Every
  one already does: merging accumulates into its own object, and `css.raw()` and `cva.raw()` clone at the boundary.

- 2130606: Call `splitProps` predicates with the key alone.

  The predicate was handed straight to `Array.prototype.filter`, which calls it with `(key, index, allKeys)`. A
  one-parameter predicate cannot see the extra arguments, but a memoized one reads its whole argument list — and the
  predicate the JSX factory passes is `isCssProperty`, which is memoized. So the memo hashed the entire key array once
  per prop, and keyed its cache on it: two elements with different prop sets shared no entry even for the same prop
  name.

  Every styled element pays this, once per prop, on every render.
  - `splitProps` with a memoized predicate: **6.0x** faster
  - A React SSR render of styled elements: **4.18 → 1.15 µs** per element (3.6x)
  - The same for elements with a `cva` config: **11.2 → 2.17 µs** per element (5.2x)
  - Markup and `splitProps` output are unchanged

  Predicates have always been typed `(key: string) => boolean`, so no typed caller could have read the extra arguments.

## 1.13.1

## 1.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 7bf6798: Lower a single dynamic style value to a class the runtime builds by concatenation, instead of leaving a
  `css()` call behind.

  `css({ margin: '2', color: tone })` folded to `cx("m_2", css({ color: tone }))`. It now folds to
  `cx("m_2", cssLeaf("c_", "color", tone))`, where `c_` is resolved at build time and the runtime only appends the
  value. Measured against the `css()` call it replaces: 2.2x when the memo would have hit, 43x when it would have missed
  — which is every SSR render, and any value that cycles past the memo's 1000-entry ceiling.

  This is sound because `css()` already builds the class from the value alone. `utility.transform` is string
  construction over a table fixed at build time and nothing consults which rules were emitted, so `css({ color: tone })`
  already returns `c_<tone>` for a value the extractor never saw, with no CSS behind it. The lowered form produces the
  same string in the same cases.

  Three shapes do not reduce to one class and fall back to `css()` at runtime, so nothing is lost: a responsive array, a
  condition object, and any non-scalar. `null` and `undefined` produce no class, as before. A value carrying whitespace
  or `!important` still resolves correctly but takes a regex path that is slower than a memo hit, so a call whose value
  always has one is better left alone.

  It applies to a top-level property of a single-argument `css()` call, with `hash` and `cssMode: 'grouped'` declining
  automatically — neither produces a class the value is merely appended to. Condition keys are declined too, since their
  value is an object in every real use. Turn it off with `partial: false`, alongside the rest of the splitting.

  Two notes for upgrades. `cssLeaf` is emitted by the generator, so a project whose `styled-system/` was generated
  before this release must be regenerated — the transform emits an import of it, and a stale runtime has no such export.
  And `sanitize` is now exported from `@bamboocss/shared`, so the class-name pipeline has one implementation rather than
  a copy in `leafClass`.

- a5cb5a8: Add `pruneUnusedTokens`, dropping token css variables nothing can reach.

  The token layer declares every token in the theme. An app uses a fraction of them, so most of what it declares is dead
  weight in the one stylesheet that blocks first paint. On the `vite-ts` sandbox, with the default preset, this takes
  `styles.css` from 24,433 to 12,293 bytes — 6,398 to 3,504 gzipped. It scales with the size of the design system rather
  than the app: `preset-bamboo` declares 432 variables, `preset-atlaskit` 837, `preset-open-props` 898.

  It is **off by default** and changes nothing until switched on.

  A variable is kept when the generated css references it, when a kept variable's own value references it, or when it is
  named by `token()` or `token.var()` or a literal `var(--x)` anywhere under `include`. Tokens that javascript receives
  as a reference rather than a literal are always kept, because `token('colors.text')` hands the caller a `var()`
  whether or not the css mentions it. That covers virtual tokens, any token carrying a condition, and negative tokens —
  `spacing.-4` resolves to `calc(var(--spacing-4) * -1)`, so what has to survive is the _positive_ token's declaration,
  not its own. So is anything a theme refers to: a theme is a separate artifact injected at runtime, so nothing in the
  sheet points at what it needs.

  The negative-token rule is the one with a visible price, and there is no opt-out. A spacing scale generates one
  negative per entry, so the whole scale is pinned whether or not the app uses it: on the default preset an app
  referencing a single colour keeps 37 spacing variables, about a third of everything that survives. Presets with large
  spacing scales therefore see less than the numbers above.

  The walk follows any custom property, not only the removable ones. A colour palette is what forces that:
  `colorPalette: 'red'` emits `--colors-color-palette-300: var(--colors-red-300)`, and those palette properties are
  virtual, so stopping at them would leave the rule pointing at colours that had been removed.

  Two limits are deliberate:
  - Only custom properties the token system declares are eligible. `globalCss` output is never touched. `preset-base`
    declares the filter and gradient composition properties on the universal selector precisely so a parent's value
    cannot inherit into a descendant; they look unreferenced, and removing them would change rendering. The `styles.css`
    post-processing this option replaces does remove them.
  - Reachability cannot be proven for every reference. A token named by a path the source does not spell out as a string
    literal — `token.var(key)` — one used only from a stylesheet outside `include`, or one consumed by a separate
    package treating the output as design tokens, is invisible. Keep those with `staticCss`.

  Pruning runs wherever a complete stylesheet is assembled — `bamboo`, `bamboo cssgen`, watch mode and the PostCSS
  plugin — and never on a partial one such as `cssgen tokens`, where nothing would be left to reference the tokens.
  Collecting the references reads every source file, so that work stays behind the flag.

### Patch Changes

- 9ffb84f: Cache `css()` and pattern class names in the generated runtime, and stop `css.raw()` sharing a mutable
  object.

  `memo` now keys flat arguments on a structural hash confirmed by an exact comparison, falling back to `JSON.stringify`
  only for nested styles. Repeated `css()` calls get roughly 4-5x faster, multi-argument calls about 4x, and pattern
  helpers — which were not memoized at all — about 1.3x. Class name output is unchanged.

  Two behaviour changes worth knowing about:
  - The cache is now **bounded**. It previously grew for the lifetime of the process, which leaked in long-lived SSR
    workers (~16MB retained after 50k distinct styles, versus ~3MB now). The trade is that a workload whose set of
    distinct styles exceeds the bound no longer benefits from caching, and is slower than it was; a workload that reuses
    styles — the reason the cache exists — is substantially faster.
  - `css.raw()` returns a fresh object. It previously handed every caller the same cached instance, so a caller mutating
    what it received corrupted the cache and the class names produced afterwards. The copy is shallow, so mutating a
    nested condition object inside a `raw()` result still reaches shared state.

- e482ab3: Stop charging every merge for a copy only `raw()` needs.

  Merged style objects are cached, so `css.raw()` and `cva.raw()` have to hand out something independent — a caller
  mutating what it received would otherwise change what every later caller reads. That guarantee was previously supplied
  by making `mergeProps` copy nested objects, which put the cost on every merge instead of the two places that need it.

  Merging runs on every `css()` cache miss, and on every render of a pattern component under `jsxStyleProps: 'minimal'`.
  Copying there cost roughly twice as much as merging alone for a realistic style object — five base properties and four
  condition blocks — and the overhead scales with nesting, so it fell on exactly the styles people write.

  `mergeProps` is a merge again, and a new `cloneStyles` helper supplies the copy at the two boundaries where the value
  reaches user code. The independence guarantee is unchanged; the call site now says what it is doing.

  The template-literal `css.raw()` also routes through `cloneStyles`, so both syntaxes offer the same guarantee. It
  previously relied on the merge copying for it.

- 11c9409: Stop the generated runtime's memo treating differently-shaped arguments as equal.

  Cached arguments were compared as a flat bag of key/value pairs enumerated with `for...in`, which diverges from what
  the memoized functions actually read in two ways:
  - An array and an object with the same numeric keys enumerate identically, so `['x']` and `{ 0: 'x' }` shared a cache
    entry.
  - `for...in` walks the prototype chain, so an object with inherited enumerable properties was compared as though it
    owned them, while `Object.keys` and `JSON.stringify` see nothing.

  In both cases the second caller received a result computed from the first caller's arguments. No user-reachable
  miscompilation was found — style objects reaching that path are plain, and arrays of styles or responsive values are
  nested and take a different route — but the guarantee the memo documents was not one it kept, and the failure would
  surface as an inexplicable class name.

  Arrays are now distinguished from objects, and any value carrying a custom prototype is keyed by serialization
  instead, which sees exactly what the wrapped function does.

- 9ffb84f: Key scalar arguments by value in the generated runtime's memo.

  Every non-object argument hashed to the same constant, so distinct strings shared one bucket and competed for its
  fixed number of slots. Past that count the hit rate fell to zero and each call also paid a scan of the bucket and a
  fresh snapshot of its arguments.

  This hit `isCssProperty`, which is called for every prop on every render when `jsx.styleProps` is `'all'` (the
  default) and sees hundreds of distinct property names — so the hottest path in the runtime was missing its cache
  entirely.

  Scalars now hash by value, and a call with a single scalar argument is keyed directly, which is the shape of the
  callers that run most often.

- 9ffb84f: Stop `cva.raw()`, `sva.raw()` and `css.raw()` handing out shared, mutable style objects.

  Merged results are cached, so returning one directly means a caller that mutates what it received changes what every
  later caller reads:

  ```js
  const styles = button.raw({ size: 'sm' })
  styles.color = 'red' // used to poison the cached entry
  button.raw({ size: 'sm' }) // every later caller saw color: 'red'
  ```

  `css.raw()` already copied, but only at the top level, and the merge underneath kept references to the caller's nested
  objects — so a condition object such as `_hover` was shared even through that copy. Merging now copies nested objects
  and arrays instead of pointing at the source, and all three `raw()` helpers return a fully independent object.

  Class name output is unchanged.

- a966bae: Make `splitProps` faster by reading each key's descriptor instead of building one for the whole object, and
  by answering key membership from the own-keys list rather than by asking the object per key.

  Roughly 2.4–2.9x on plain and frozen props, 1.2x on accessor props, and about even on the proxy Solid's `mergeProps`
  hands over — the shapes that carry something to preserve keep the descriptor path and most of its cost.

  It called `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors` up front and `Object.defineProperty` for every key it moved. That is paid
  once per element per render, and the descriptor path is only needed for keys that have something to preserve.

  An accessor still stays an accessor — Solid compiles props to accessors, and reading one during a split would build a
  component's children before their provider exists — a non-enumerable key stays non-enumerable, and `__proto__` is
  defined rather than assigned so it stays an own property.

  One thing does change: a key taken from frozen props — React freezes them in development — arrives writable, because
  `writable`/`configurable` are carried over only on the descriptor path. Assigning to a split bucket used to throw in
  strict mode and now succeeds. Nothing in the framework mutates one.

  Two long-standing bugs go with it: a group naming `toString`, `constructor` or another `Object.prototype` member used
  to be handed one and put `undefined` in its bucket, and that spurious key also reached the rest bucket.

      },
    },
    variants: {
      size: {
        sm: {
          root: {
            padding: '10px',
          },

  Then, use like this:

  ```tsx
  <CardRoot size="sm">
    <CardLabel>Hello</CardLabel>
  </CardRoot>
  ```

## 0.54.0

### Patch Changes

- efa060d: Improve algorithm for deterministic property order.
  - Longhand (`padding`, `margin`, `inset`)
  - Shorthand of longhands (`padding-inline`, `margin-inline`)
  - Shorthand of shorthands (`padding-inline-start`, `margin-inline-start`)

  ```tsx
  css({
    p: '4',
    pr: '2',
    px: '10',
  })
  ```

  Will result in the following css regardless of the order of the properties:

  ```css
  .p-4 {
    padding: 4px;
  }

  .px-10 {
    padding-left: 10px;
    padding-right: 10px;
  }

  .pr-2 {
    padding-right: 2px;
  }
  ```

- d2aede5: Reduce the size of the generated `Token` type by referencing category tokens.

  **Before:**

  ```ts
  export type Token = 'colors.green.400' | 'colors.red.400'

  export type ColorToken = 'green.400' | 'red.400'
  ```

  **After:**

  ```ts
  export type Token = `colors.${ColorToken}`

  export type ColorToken = 'green.400' | 'red.400'
  ```

- 54426a2: Add support native css nesting in template literal mode. Prior to this change, you need to add `&` to all
  nested selectors.

  Before:

  css`
    & p {
      color: red;

  `
  ```

  After:

  ```ts
  css`
    p {

### Patch Changes

- 935ec86: Allow passing arrays of `SystemStyleObject` to the `css(xxx, [aaa, bbb, ccc], yyy)` fn

  This is useful when you are creating your own styled component and want to benefit
  [from the recent `css` array property support](https://github.com/gajus/bamboocss/pull/2515).

  ```diff
  import { css } from 'styled-system/css'
  import type { HTMLStyledProps } from 'styled-system/types'

  type ButtonProps = HTMLStyledProps<'button'>

  export const Button = ({ css: cssProp = {}, children }: ButtonProps) => {

  +  const className = css(cssProp)
    return <button className={className}>{children}</button>
  }
  ```

  export default defineConfig({
    // ...
    patterns: {
      extend: {
        grid: {

  })
  ```

## 0.37.0

### Patch Changes

- 7daf159: Fix a bug where some styles would be grouped together in the same rule, even if they were not related to each
  other.

  ## Internal details

  This was caused by an object reference being re-used while setting a property deeply in the hashes decoding process,
  leading to the mutation of a previous style object with additional properties.

## 0.31.0

### Minor Changes

- f0296249: - Sort the longhand/shorthand atomic rules in a deterministic order to prevent property conflicts
  - Automatically merge the `base` object in the `css` root styles in the runtime
  - This may be a breaking change depending on how your styles are created

  Ex:

  ```ts
  css({
    padding: '1px',
    paddingTop: '3px',
    paddingBottom: '4px',
  })
  ```

  Will now always generate the following css:

  ```css
  @layer utilities {
    .p_1px {
      padding: 1px;
    }

    .pt_3px {
      padding-top: 3px;
    }

      padding-bottom: 4px;
    }
  }
  ```

## 0.30.2

## 0.30.1

## 0.30.0

### Patch Changes

- ab32d1d7: Introduce 3 new hooks:

  ## `tokens:created`

  This hook is called when the token engine has been created. You can use this hook to add your format token names and
  variables.

  > This is especially useful when migrating from other css-in-js libraries, like Stitches.

  ```ts
  export default defineConfig({
    // ...
    hooks: {
      'tokens:created': ({ configure }) => {
        configure({
          formatTokenName: (path) => '
  ```

## 0.27.0

### Minor Changes

- 84304901: Improve performance, mostly for the CSS generation by removing a lot of `postcss` usage (and plugins).

  ## Public changes:
  - Introduce a new `config.lightningcss` option to use `lightningcss` (currently disabled by default) instead of
    `postcss`.
  - Add a new `config.browserslist` option to configure the browserslist used by `lightningcss`.
  - Add a `--lightningcss` flag to the `bamboo` and `bamboo cssgen` command to use `lightningcss` instead of `postcss`
    for this run.

  ## Internal changes:
  - `markImportant` fn from JS instead of walking through postcss AST nodes
  - use a fork of `stitches` `stringify` function instead of `postcss-css-in-js` to write the CSS string from a JS
    object
  - only compute once `TokenDictionary` properties
  - refactor `serializeStyle` to use the same code path as the rest of the pipeline with `StyleEncoder` / `StyleDecoder`
    and rename it to `transformStyles` to better convey what it does

### Patch Changes

- 74ac0d9d: Improve the performance of the runtime transform functions by caching their results (css, cva, sva,
  recipe/slot recipe, patterns)

  > See detailed breakdown of the performance improvements
  > [here](https://github.com/gajus/bamboocss/pull/1986#issuecomment-1887459483) based on the React Profiler.

  ```ts
  import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

    color: '#fff',
    // @ts-expect-error TS will throw when using from strictTokens: true

### Minor Changes

- 12281ff8: Improve support for styled element composition. This ensures that you can compose two styled elements
  together and the styles will be merged correctly.

  ```jsx
  const Box = styled('div', {
    base: {
      background: 'red.light',
      color: 'white',
    },
  })

  const ExtendedBox = styled(Box, {
    base: { background: 'red.dark' },
  })

  // <ExtendedBox> will have a background of `red.dark` and a color of `white`
  ```

  **Limitation:** This feature does not allow compose mixed styled composition. A mixed styled composition happens when
  an element is created from a cva/inline cva, and another created from a config recipe.
  - CVA or Inline CVA + CVA or Inline CVA = ✅
  - Config Recipe + Config Recipe = ✅
  - CVA or Inline CVA + Config Recipe = ❌

  ```jsx
  import { button } from '../styled-system/recipes'

  const Button = styled('div', button)

  // ❌ This will throw an error
  const ExtendedButton = styled(Button, {
    base: { background: 'red.dark' },
  })

### Minor Changes

- a669f4d5: Introduce new slot recipe features.

  Slot recipes are useful for styling composite or multi-part components easily.
  - `sva`: the slot recipe version of `cva`
  - `defineSlotRecipe`: the slot recipe version of `defineRecipe`

  **Definition**

  ```jsx
  import { sva } from 'styled-system/css'

  const button = sva({
    slots: ['label', 'icon'],
    base: {
      label: { color: 'red', textDecoration: 'underline' },
    },
    variants: {
      rounded: {
        true: {},
      },
      size: {
        sm: {
          label: { fontSize: 'sm' },
          icon: { fontSize: 'sm' },
        },
        lg: {
          label: { fontSize: 'lg' },
          icon: { fontSize: 'lg', color: 'pink' },
        },
      },
    },
    defaultVariants: {
      size: 'sm',
    },
  })
  ```

  **Usage**

  ```jsx
  export function App() {
    const btnClass = button({ size: 'lg', rounded: true })

    return (
      <button>
        <p class={btnClass.label}> Label</p>
        <p class={btnClass.icon}> Icon</p>
      </button>
    )
  }
  ```

### Patch Changes

- 24e783b3: Reduce the overall `outdir` size, introduce the new config `jsxStyleProps` option to disable style props and
  further reduce it.

  `config.jsxStyleProps`:
  - When set to 'all', all style props are allowed.
  - When set to 'minimal', only the `css` prop is allowed.
  - When set to 'none', no style props are allowed and therefore the `jsxFactory` will not be usable as a component:
    - `<styled.div />` and `styled("div")` aren't valid
    - but the recipe usage is still valid `styled("div", { base: { color: "red.300" }, variants: { ...} })`

## 0.6.0

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- c0335cf4: Fix the `astish` shared function when using `config.syntax: 'template-literal'`

  ex: css`${someVar}`

  if a value is unresolvable in the static analysis step, it would be interpreted as `undefined`, and `astish` would
  throw:

  > TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'replace')

- 762fd0c9: Fix issue where the `walkObject` shared helper would set an object key to a nullish value

  Example:

  ```ts
  const shorthands = {
    flexDir: 'flexDirection',
  }

  const obj = {
    flexDir: 'row',
    flexDirection: undefined,
  }

  const result = walkObject(obj, (value) => value, {
    getKey(prop) {
      return shorthands[prop] ?? prop
    },
  })
  ```

  This would set the `flexDirection` to `row` (using `getKey`) and then set the `flexDirection` property again, this
  time to `undefined`, since it existed in the original object

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- ead9eaa3: Add support for tagged template literal version.

  This features is pure css approach to writing styles, and can be a great way to migrate from styled-components and
  emotion.

  Set the `syntax` option to `template-literal` in the bamboo config to enable this feature.

  ```js
  // bamboo.config.ts
  export default defineConfig({
    //...
    syntax: 'template-literal',
  })
  ```

  > For existing projects, you might need to run the `bamboo codegen --clean`

  You can also use the `--syntax` option to specify the syntax type when using the CLI.

  ```sh
  bamboo init -p --syntax template-literal
  ```

  To get autocomplete for token variables, consider using the
  [CSS Var Autocomplete](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=phoenisx.cssvar) extension.

## `utility:created`

This hook is called when the internal classname engine has been created. You can override the default `toHash` function
used when `config.hash` is set to `true`

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  hooks: {
    'utility:created': ({ configure }) => {
      configure({
        toHash: (paths, toHash) => {

          const splitConds = stringConds.split('_')
          const hashConds = splitConds.map(toHash)
          return hashConds.join('_')
        },
      })
    },
  },
})
````

## `codegen:prepare`

This hook is called right before writing the codegen files to disk. You can use this hook to tweak the codegen files

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  hooks: {
    'codegen:prepare': ({ artifacts, changed }) => {
      // do something with the emitted js/d.ts files
    },
  },
})

- 84304901: Improve performance, mostly for the CSS generation by removing a lot of `postcss` usage (and plugins).

  ## Public changes:
  - Introduce a new `config.lightningcss` option to use `lightningcss` (currently disabled by default) instead of
    `postcss`.
  - Add a new `config.browserslist` option to configure the browserslist used by `lightningcss`.
  - Add a `--lightningcss` flag to the `bamboo` and `bamboo cssgen` command to use `lightningcss` instead of `postcss`
    for this run.

  ## Internal changes:
  - `markImportant` fn from JS instead of walking through postcss AST nodes
  - use a fork of `stitches` `stringify` function instead of `postcss-css-in-js` to write the CSS string from a JS
    object
  - only compute once `TokenDictionary` properties
  - refactor `serializeStyle` to use the same code path as the rest of the pipeline with `StyleEncoder` / `StyleDecoder`
    and rename it to `transformStyles` to better convey what it does

### Patch Changes

- 74ac0d9d: Improve the performance of the runtime transform functions by caching their results (css, cva, sva,
  recipe/slot recipe, patterns)

  > See detailed breakdown of the performance improvements
  > [here](https://github.com/gajus/bamboocss/pull/1986#issuecomment-1887459483) based on the React Profiler.

## 0.21.0

### Minor Changes

- 26e6051a: Add an escape-hatch for arbitrary values when using `config.strictTokens`, by prefixing the value with `[`
  and suffixing with `]`, e.g. writing `[123px]` as a value will bypass the token validation.

  ```ts
  import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

  css({
    // @ts-expect-error TS will throw when using from strictTokens: true
    color: '#fff',
    // @ts-expect-error TS will throw when using from strictTokens: true
    width: '100px',

    // ✅ but this is now allowed:
    bgColor: '[rgb(51 155 240)]',
    fontSize: '[12px]',
  })

## 0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- 12281ff8: Improve support for styled element composition. This ensures that you can compose two styled elements
  together and the styles will be merged correctly.

  ```jsx
  const Box = styled('div', {
    base: {
      background: 'red.light',
      color: 'white',
    },
  })

  const ExtendedBox = styled(Box, {
    base: { background: 'red.dark' },
  })

  // <ExtendedBox> will have a background of `red.dark` and a color of `white`
  ```

  **Limitation:** This feature does not allow compose mixed styled composition. A mixed styled composition happens when
  an element is created from a cva/inline cva, and another created from a config recipe.
  - CVA or Inline CVA + CVA or Inline CVA = ✅
  - Config Recipe + Config Recipe = ✅
  - CVA or Inline CVA + Config Recipe = ❌

  ```jsx
  import { button } from '../styled-system/recipes'

  const Button = styled('div', button)

  // ❌ This will throw an error
  const ExtendedButton = styled(Button, {
    base: { background: 'red.dark' },
  })
  ```

### Minor Changes

- a669f4d5: Introduce new slot recipe features.

  Slot recipes are useful for styling composite or multi-part components easily.
  - `sva`: the slot recipe version of `cva`
  - `defineSlotRecipe`: the slot recipe version of `defineRecipe`

  **Definition**

  ```jsx
  import { sva } from 'styled-system/css'

  const button = sva({
    slots: ['label', 'icon'],
    base: {
      label: { color: 'red', textDecoration: 'underline' },
    },
    variants: {
      rounded: {
        true: {},
      },
      size: {
        sm: {
          label: { fontSize: 'sm' },
          icon: { fontSize: 'sm' },
        },
        lg: {
          label: { fontSize: 'lg' },
          icon: { fontSize: 'lg', color: 'pink' },
        },
      },
    },
    defaultVariants: {
      size: 'sm',
    },
  })
  ```

  **Usage**

  ```jsx
  export function App() {
    const btnClass = button({ size: 'lg', rounded: true })

    return (
      <button>
        <p class={btnClass.label}> Label</p>
        <p class={btnClass.icon}> Icon</p>
      </button>
    )
  }
  ```

### Patch Changes

- 24e783b3: Reduce the overall `outdir` size, introduce the new config `jsxStyleProps` option to disable style props and
  further reduce it.

  `config.jsxStyleProps`:
  - When set to 'all', all style props are allowed.
  - When set to 'minimal', only the `css` prop is allowed.
  - When set to 'none', no style props are allowed and therefore the `jsxFactory` will not be usable as a component:
    - `<styled.div />` and `styled("div")` aren't valid
    - but the recipe usage is still valid `styled("div", { base: { color: "red.300" }, variants: { ...} })`

## 0.6.0

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- c0335cf4: Fix the `astish` shared function when using `config.syntax: 'template-literal'`

  ex: css`${someVar}`

  if a value is unresolvable in the static analysis step, it would be interpreted as `undefined`, and `astish` would
  throw:

  > TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'replace')

- 762fd0c9: Fix issue where the `walkObject` shared helper would set an object key to a nullish value

  Example:

  ```ts
  const shorthands = {
    flexDir: 'flexDirection',
  }

  const obj = {
    flexDir: 'row',
    flexDirection: undefined,
  }

  const result = walkObject(obj, (value) => value, {
    getKey(prop) {
      return shorthands[prop] ?? prop
    },
  })
  ```

  This would set the `flexDirection` to `row` (using `getKey`) and then set the `flexDirection` property again, this
  time to `undefined`, since it existed in the original object

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- ead9eaa3: Add support for tagged template literal version.

  This features is pure css approach to writing styles, and can be a great way to migrate from styled-components and
  emotion.

  Set the `syntax` option to `template-literal` in the bamboo config to enable this feature.

  ```js
  // bamboo.config.ts
  export default defineConfig({
    //...
    syntax: 'template-literal',
  })
  ```

  > For existing projects, you might need to run the `bamboo codegen --clean`

  You can also use the `--syntax` option to specify the syntax type when using the CLI.

  ```sh
  bamboo init -p --syntax template-literal
  ```

  To get autocomplete for token variables, consider using the
  [CSS Var Autocomplete](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=phoenisx.cssvar) extension.
