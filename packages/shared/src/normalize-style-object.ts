/**
 * Whether walking the object would only rebuild it.
 *
 * Normalizing does two things: it renames a shorthand to its longhand and drops nullish
 * leaves. A flat object of plain values written in longhand needs neither, and that is most
 * of what `css()` is handed — but it still paid for a full rebuild plus a path array per key.
 *
 * Every clause has to be exact, since a false positive returns an object the walk would have
 * changed. Nullish is one of them: a leaf the walk removes must not survive, or a later merge
 * would see it override the value beneath it. The array check is another, and it is on the
 * container as well as the values — `stop` is handed the container, so an array arriving at
 * the top level has to reach the walk to be rejected rather than being returned as it came.
 *
 * `for...in` reads inherited keys the walk ignores, which is safe in the only direction it can
 * be wrong — an extra key can send this to the slow path, never past it.
 *
 * It does read every value, as `compactStyles` and the argument memo already do, so an
 * accessor prop is read once more than before. Style props are values by the time they get
 * here and reading one has no effect, but it is the reason this cannot be reordered to read
 * lazily.

/**
 * The result may be the argument itself rather than a fresh object, so callers have to treat

 *
 * An array is not a style value. It used to be read as one value per breakpoint, which meant
 * a font stack written the way CSS writes one — `['Inter', 'sans-serif']` — silently became
 * `Inter` at base and `sans-serif` at `sm`. The type no longer admits an array, so reaching
 * this throw takes a cast or untyped javascript; it says which property, since the walk knows
 * the path and the caller usually does not.
