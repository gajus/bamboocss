   * Whether to drop token css variables nothing asks for.
   *
   * The token layer declares every token in the theme, and an app typically uses a small
   * fraction of them, so this is usually the largest single saving in render-blocking css.
   *
   * A variable is kept when the generated css references it, when a kept variable's own value
   * references it, or when javascript under `include` names it — a `token()` or `token.value()`
   * call, or a literal `var(--x)` written by hand. Paths are read through a constant or a
   * template literal the extractor can follow, not only from a literal spelled at the call.
   *
   * A path the build cannot follow falls back to keeping every declaration rather than
   * silently dropping one, because `token()` hands back a `var()` for every token and an
   * unreadable path could name any of them. `unresolvedPath` decides whether that fallback is
   * reported, and `keepTokens` replaces it with a bound you declare.
   *
   * A template literal is bounded rather than declined: `` token(`colors.${shade}`) `` cannot
   * say which token it wants, but it says which it *cannot*, so the `colors` category is kept
   * and nothing else. That covers the commonest dynamic read outright. What it does not cover
   * is a path with no static head — `token(key)`, `token('colors.' + shade)` — and there
   * `keepTokens` is the answer.
   *
   * A local binding named `token` is not the artifact and is not a reference: `token` is the
   * obvious name for a token *object*, and `items.map((token) => token.value)` reads a
   * parameter. Parameters, catch variables, function and class declarations, and a variable
   * destructured off one of those are all resolved rather than matched by spelling.
   *
   * Three things stay invisible: a token named by a path assembled from a value that only
   * exists at runtime, one referenced only from a stylesheet outside `include`, and one used
   * by a separate package consuming the output as design tokens. The scan reads `include`,
   * which scopes style extraction rather than everything that may import — so a script, a
   * config, or a sibling workspace package that calls `token()` is not covered, nor is a
   * binding renamed away from `token`, as in `const t = token`. Name them with `keepTokens`.
   *
   * A custom property declared by `global.css` or `global.vars` is not one of these cases:
   * the declaration ships whether or not anything in the stylesheet reads it, so whatever it
   * references is kept alongside it.
   *
   * This was three strategies — `'off' | 'reachable' | 'accounted'` — which conflated two
   * separate questions: how hard to try, and what to say when it fails. `'reachable'` answered
   * one cheap boolean ("does any javascript reach for a token") and threw away everything else
   * it had read, so a single `token()` call anywhere kept all 468 declarations of the default
   * preset. `'accounted'` did the work but was framed as an assertion, so it reported by
   * default and had to be asked for. Doing the work is now the default and saying so is
   * `unresolvedPath`; a file that never spells `token` is skipped, so the accounting costs
   * nothing where there is nothing to account for.
   *

  /**
   * Token paths to keep whatever the build can see, as exact names or `*` patterns.
   *
   * ```ts
   * prune: { keepTokens: ['colors.*'] }
   * ```
   *
   * This is the bound the build could not infer, written by hand. It exists because the
   * fallback is otherwise total: **one** reference the accounting cannot follow keeps every
   * declaration in the project, so a codebase with a single `token(key)` in it gets the same
   * stylesheet as one that never prunes — and the codebases that reach for `token()` most are
   * exactly the ones that end up there. Naming the category those dynamic reads land in is a
   * far smaller answer than keeping everything, and it is the same answer the build already
   * derives for itself from a template literal's static head.
   *
   * So this does two things: it keeps what it matches, and it stands in for what could not be
   * followed, in place of the blanket keep. Saying `keepTokens: ['colors.*']` is saying *the
   * reads you cannot follow land in `colors`* — an assertion about your own code, which is why
   * nothing infers it for you. Under `unresolvedPath: 'warn'` the declines are still printed, so
   * you can see what you are covering; `'error'` fails, because asserting every path resolves and
   * declaring a bound for the ones that do not are contradictory requests.
   *
   * With nothing to stand in for it is additive only, naming a token nothing in the stylesheet
   * references and no javascript here reads — one consumed by a sibling package, or by css
   * outside `include`. It is inert under `tokens: false`, which keeps everything already.
   *
   * Patterns match the dotted token *path*, anchored and case-sensitively, with `*` standing
   * for any run of characters and a leading `!` excluding. `colors.*` keeps every colour,
   * `colors.brand.*` one palette, `colors.red.300` one token, `['colors.*', '!colors.legacy.*']`
   * every colour but one palette.
   *
   * The path, not the css variable: a token is `fontSizes.3xl` and its declaration is
   * `--font-sizes-3xl`, so `font-sizes.*` — the natural thing to write after reading
   * `styles.css` — matches nothing at all. A pattern matching no token is reported, and names
   * the spelling that would have worked, because keeping nothing is otherwise silent in a build
   * whose whole job here is dropping things.
   *
   * This replaces `staticCss` as the way to keep a category alive. `staticCss` emits utility
   * *classes* — keeping the colours meant shipping a rule per colour to hold the declarations
   * up, which is a larger stylesheet than the pruning saved.

   * declaration that *survives* `tokens` names it, and when it appears anywhere under

   * `style` rather than through bamboo. That textual fallback is deliberately
   * over-inclusive: keeping an unused keyframe costs bytes, dropping a used one breaks the
   * animation.
   *
   * The middle one is why this cannot be read off the stylesheet alone. `--animations-drawer:
   * slide-in-right 400ms` reaches its keyframe only if something reaches the property, and a
   * property can be reached from outside the css entirely — a `token()` call, a `keepTokens`
   * pattern, a theme, a `globalCss` export. Those are exactly the tokens `tokens` keeps, so
   * this defers to that pass rather than asking again: a keyframe is dropped only when the
   * declarations naming it were dropped too. Under `tokens: false` nothing is removable, so
   * every keyframe a declaration names is kept.

   * What to do about a style value shaped like a token path that resolves to no token.
   *
   * - `off` says nothing.
   * - `warn` logs each one as it is transformed.
   * - `error` fails the build, listing every one it found.
   *
   * Every branch of the resolver ends in `|| value`, so an unknown path is emitted as
   * written: `background: 'accent.default'` ships as `background: accent.default`. That
   * parses, so nothing downstream objects and the stylesheet is valid — the browser drops the
   * declaration at compute time and the style is simply absent. It surfaces as "this colour
   * never applied", a long way from the typo that caused it, and a build carrying one warns
   * identically on every run until somebody happens to read the log.
   *
   * `warn` is the default because the test is a *shape*: a dotted value against the set of
   * values the property enumerates. That is right about a mistyped token and cannot be sure
   * about a literal, so escalating it is a choice a project makes once it knows its own
   * source is clean. `[accent.default]` marks a value as literal and is never reported.
   *
   * Not to be confused with {@link PruneOptions.unresolvedPath}, which is about a `token()`
   * *call* whose path the prune scan cannot follow statically — a question about pruning
   * coverage, asked of a token that usually exists. This one is about a token that does not.
   *
   * A binding that does not exist is not graded here and always throws: that is read off an
   * entrypoint's own export list rather than inferred, so there is no setting under which it
   * is what someone meant.
   *
   * Two halves, graded apart, because they are not equally certain.
   *
   * A property that draws from a token category — `color` from `colors`, `top` from `spacing` —
   * makes a name that is not a token bamboo's own bookkeeping, and there is no third party to be
   * wrong about it. That half defaults to `'error'`.
   *
   * Everywhere else the judge is the CSS grammar, whose data lags the spec: `containerType:
   * 'scroll-state'` is valid CSS that the grammar has not caught up with. Sweeping every keyword
   * csstype enumerates through it found 8 such disagreements in 10,128 pairs — 0.08%, and all 8
   * on properties with no token category. That half defaults to `'warn'`, so a build is never
   * failed by how fresh a grammar is.
   *
   * A single severity applies to both.
   *
   * @default { token: 'error', grammar: 'warn' }
