   * are authored by the consumer somewhere below. Naming the enclosing slots lets the build
   * emit their variant styles as rules scoped by a class those slots already carry, so
   * nothing has to be delivered to a slot at runtime and every other slot's class is a
   * constant.
   *
   * A list, because a portal is a real discontinuity in the tree and no CSS mechanism
   * crosses one. A `<Select>` occupies two disjoint subtrees — the trigger side under
   * `root`, the listbox side under a portaled `positioner` — and a variant writes styles
   * into both. One anchor can only ever reach one of them.
   *
   * ```ts
   * scopeRoots: ['root', 'positioner']
   * ```
   *
   * Each named slot takes variant props; every other slot's class is a constant. The build
   * emits each non-anchor slot's variant rules under *every* anchor, and only the anchor
   * that is genuinely an ancestor matches — so the DOM shape never has to be declared.
   *
   * Defaults to `['root']` when a slot by that name exists. Set `[]` to turn scoping off
   * and give every slot a variant class of its own, which is what a recipe whose slots are
   * siblings wants.
   *
   * A slot under *no* anchor is still unreachable, and nothing at build time can detect
   * that — reachability is a fact about the DOM.
