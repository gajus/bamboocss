/**
 * A folded class has to be a class the stylesheet carries, under every option that changes
 * how a class is named.
 *
 * Three things derive these names independently: the decoder that writes the stylesheet, the
 * generated runtime, and `runtime-css.ts`, which rebuilds `createCss` in-process for the fold.
 * They agree by construction only as long as each reads the same options — and that has failed
 * twice already, both times because a naming option reached one derivation and not another:
 * compound selectors ignored `hash` and `prefix`, and `groupClassName` re-hashed on the build
 * side alone. Both produced elements carrying a class with no rule behind it, which renders as
 * nothing and shows up in no test that only reads the emitted JavaScript.
 *
 * Before this file, `hash` appeared in one test and `prefix` in two, while `separator` appeared
 * in none. None covered the whole compiler-to-stylesheet naming agreement.
 *
 * ## What is actually independent here
 *
 * `foldSource` *uses* `runtimeCss` to name the class, so comparing its output back to
 * `runtimeCss` is close to circular: it catches the fold handing over the wrong style object,
 * which is worth catching, but it cannot tell you the name is right. The load-bearing assertion
 * is that the class appears as a rule in the stylesheet, because the stylesheet comes from the
 * decoder — a path the fold does not touch.
