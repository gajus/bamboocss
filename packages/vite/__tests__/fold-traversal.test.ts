/**
 * How many times the fold reads a module's whole AST.
 *
 * `fold.bench.ts` reports what a module costs in wall-clock, which is machine-dependent and
 * excluded from CI for exactly that reason. This counts the work instead, which is not — and the
 * work is what dominates: profiling a dev server over 24 real edits put ts-morph at 87ms per edit
 * against 2.4ms of extraction, with half the ts-morph time inside descendant iterators.
 *
 * Every `getDescendantsOfKind` and every `forEachDescendant` visits each node in the file, so
 * these counts are "how many times did we read the whole tree". The property worth holding is
 * that the number tracks the questions a module actually *answers*, not the questions it could
 * have been asked: a module with no `cx`, no `splitVariantProps` and no runtime binding should
 * not be walked for any of them.
 *
 * A count is not a stopwatch, and the two do not scale together: the pair of walks merged below
 * traded two cheap kind-filtered iterations for one `forEachDescendant`, which wraps every node
 * it visits rather than only matches, and measures ~0.8x on a cold parse rather than the 0.67x
 * a 3-to-2 count implies. What the count buys is a floor that CI can hold without a stopwatch —
 * a walk reintroduced here fails, whatever the machine is doing. `fold.bench.ts` still owns the
 * question of whether a change is faster.
 *
 * Pinned as exact numbers rather than bounds. A bound drifts upward one walk at a time with
 * nothing failing, which is how these accumulated: before the guards below, every styled module
 * paid two whole-tree reads and every reported one paid five, whatever it contained.
 *
 * What this cannot see is a walk that goes straight to `ts.forEachChild` — `identifierIndex` is
 * one, deliberately. So a zero here means "nothing took a whole-tree helper", not "nothing read
 * the tree".
 *
 * The counting moved with the backend. ts-morph put these walks on `Node.prototype`, so the
 * count was a prototype patch; TypeScript 7's nodes carry no such methods and the helpers are
 * free functions in `@bamboocss/ts-ast`, so the count is a module mock. Patching a prototype
 * that no longer has the methods silently counts nothing, which reads as a fold that walks
 * nothing at all.
