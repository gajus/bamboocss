/**
 * What happens to a folded literal when the module it was read from changes.
 *
 * The fold reports the modules it resolved through, and the plugin registers them as
 * watch files, so editing one re-transforms its consumers. On its own that achieves
 * nothing: a consumer is transformed *before* the module it imports — that is how a
 * bundler discovers imports — so the re-transform runs while the parser still holds the
 * previous contents, and folds the same stale class again.
 *
 * These need a real config and a real file on disk, because the staleness lives in
 * ts-morph's copy of a module resolved from disk. `sandbox/codegen` has the config.
 *
 * The fixture lives *beside* that project's sources rather than in them. `sandbox/codegen`
 * includes `./src/**` and `./pages/**`, and several other suites build a context from the
 * same cwd — a file written and deleted under `src/` races their glob, which reads each
 * matched path with no guard, and fails an unrelated test with `ENOENT` roughly one run in
 * four. Nothing globs this directory, and the fold does not need it to: the plugin hands
 * the parser a path directly, and the extractor resolves the import from disk.

   * fixing the *dependency* re-transforms the consumer — and retracts its signature, because a
   * pass that threw produced no output for a later edit to compare against. Reading that absence
   * as "unchanged" would suppress the module exactly when it most needs re-transforming: it has
   * no compiled result on the server at all, so the fix that would restore one never runs.
   *
   * The failure is driven by the *dependency* rather than by the consumer's own source, which is
   * what makes this test load-bearing. If the consumer's text had changed, the input digest would
   * catch it a step earlier and the retraction would never be reached. Here the consumer is
   * byte-identical throughout and its compiled output is the same before and after, so the
   * retraction is the only thing standing between the break and a permanent suppression.
