/**
 * Every identifier in this module that reads the binding `name` declared at `declaration`.
 *
 * Replaces `nameNode.findReferencesAsNodes()`, which is a TypeScript *language-service*
 * query. The first such query forces `synchronizeHostData` -> `createProgram`, binding the
 * whole transitive `.d.ts` closure of the project — the exact cost `createTsProject`'s
 * `skipAddingFilesFromTsConfig`, `skipFileDependencyResolution` and `skipLoadingLibFiles`
 * exist to avoid, and which none of them govern. On a 2,278-file app it loaded 24,081 source
 * files and 4.4 GB of AST and symbols, 80% of the heap, and OOMed the build. The retained
 * strings were `googleapis` and `typescript`; none of it can reference a recipe binding.
 *
 * A recipe binding is module-scoped or imported, so every read of it is in this file. A
 * syntactic walk answers the same question over one AST the parser has already built.
 *
 * ## Where this deliberately over-reports
 *
 * Shadowing is not resolved. If any nested scope declares the same name, every matching
 * identifier is returned rather than only the ones that bind to `declaration`. That direction
 * is chosen on purpose: over-reporting fails the build with a diagnostic naming a real line,
 * while under-reporting ships an element whose class has no rule behind it and says nothing.
 * Shadowing a recipe binding is rare; silently shipping unstyled markup is not recoverable.

/**
 * Every identifier in the module, grouped by the name it spells.
 *
 * Built once per pass and handed to each lookup, because walking the whole tree per binding
 * made that O(bindings x identifiers): a module declaring ten recipes walked its identifiers
 * ten times.
 *
 * ## Why this is a raw walk rather than `getDescendantsOfKind`
 *
 * `SyntaxKind.Identifier` sorts *below* `SyntaxKind.FirstNode`, which is what ts-morph tests to
 * decide whether it may search the parse tree. For a kind below that line it falls back to
 * materialising the whole **token** tree — every brace, comma and keyword becomes a ts-morph node
 * on the way to collecting the identifiers. On 55 KB of real tsx that measured 22ms against
 * 0.22ms for the same collection over compiler nodes, and the node cache does not help: a second
 * call cost the same 22ms.
 *
 * Wrapping is what costs, so only the buckets a caller actually reads are wrapped, on the first
 * read and cached after. Nothing enumerates this index — both callers ask for one name — so the
 * rest is never built. `_getNodeFromCompilerNode` is ts-morph's own memoized wrapper factory, so
 * a node handed back here is the very object `getDescendantsOfKind` would have returned, which
 * `localReferencesTo` depends on: it compares against the declaration by identity.
 *
 * JSDoc is walked explicitly. `ts.forEachChild` does not descend into it, while the token path
 * this replaces does, so a name mentioned only in a `@type` annotation was previously found and
 * would otherwise stop being — a silent narrowing of what counts as a surviving reference.
 * Keyed on `escapedText` because that is what ts-morph's `Identifier.getText()` returns: the name
 * as the compiler resolves it, so `\u0062adge` and `badge` share a bucket exactly as before.
 *
 * Deliberately *not* memoized across passes, unlike the module-scope names beside it. That
 * cache holds strings, which outlive anything; this one holds nodes, and a node does not
 * survive its source file being replaced — `addSourceFile` overwrites, which forgets every
 * node previously taken from it. Keying on the source text does not help, because identical
 * text re-parsed is a fresh tree: the cache hits and returns nodes that throw
 * `Attempted to get information from a node that was removed or forgotten` on the next read.
