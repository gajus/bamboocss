 * Queries that make Vite serve something other than the module's own source.
 *
 * `./theme.tsx?raw` is a module whose text is `export default "…"`, and `?url`, `?worker` and
 * `?sharedworker` are wrappers of the same kind. The query has to be stripped before the
 * extension is tested — otherwise nothing matches `.tsx` — and stripping it is what made these
 * look like the file itself. The transform then handed the wrapper's text to ts-morph *under
 * the real file's path*, overwriting the parsed module every fold reads for that path.
 *
 * That is not theoretical: a module folding `css(shared)` against a sibling the entry also
 * imported as `?raw` failed the build with "1 call(s) could not be compiled" — the compiler
 * had read `export default "…"` and found no `shared` to resolve. The advice it prints, to
 * make the value statically analyzable, is unfollowable, because the source already was.
 *
 * Whether it bites depends on which of the two ids Rollup transforms last, so the same project
 * can build and then stop building because an import moved.
 *
 * A deny list rather than an allow list of benign queries: dev ids carry `?t=` after an edit
 * and `?import` when a dynamic import is rewritten, and rejecting an unrecognised one of those
 * would silently stop folding a module rather than loudly refuse it.
 *
 * Exactly these four, matching Vite's own `SPECIAL_QUERY_RE`. The list was drafted wider —
 * `?inline`, `?no-inline`, `?worklet`, `?init` — and every one of those was wrong: Vite has no
 * `worklet` query at all, `?init` is `.wasm` only and that extension is already rejected below,
 * and `inline`/`no-inline` merely pick base64-versus-file for something that *already* matched
 * `raw`/`url`, so `./a.tsx?inline` is served as the module's own source. Rejecting an id that
 * carries real source is the expensive direction: the transform declines, its atoms never reach
 * the reachability set, pruning removes their rules, and the runtime still returns the class
 * names — unstyled elements, no error. Only names verified against Vite belong here.
 *
 * Note `?worker_file`, which is how dev serves a worker's *real* source, is deliberately absent
 * and must stay absent. It contains "worker" and is the obvious next entry; adding it would
 * stop folding every worker module in dev, silently, by the mechanism above.
 *

   * in a module Vite has decided not to re-transform, so the browser and the SSR render keep
   * the old class — with no error, and with Vite and Bamboo both logging as if the edit landed.
   * A restart applies it, which is what makes it read as "recipes do not hot-reload".

   * How many dependents in a row may come back changed before the check gives up for this event.

   * it is paid on the awaited path, before Vite is told anything. That is linear in the number of
   * consumers and does not bound itself: a shared module with three hundred of them adds ~59 ms to
   * every edit, including the edits where nothing *can* be suppressed because the change moved the
   * recipe base and every consumer really did recompile.
   *
   * The trade is worth it whenever anything is suppressible. Measured on the same fan-out, a
   * suppressed consumer saves ~2.3 ms of re-transform for the ~0.23 ms its check costs, so the
   * check pays for itself at about one consumer in ten. What does not pay is the case where the
   * answer is going to be "changed" for all of them, and that case announces itself: a run of
   * consumers that all came back changed. Stopping after eight bounds it. On a three-hundred
   * consumer fan-out, an edit to the recipe base — where nothing can be suppressed — costs 3.6 ms
   * here rather than the 59 ms checking every one of them would, stacked onto an edit already
   * spending 600 ms re-transforming. A single unchanged consumer resets the run, so the same
   * fan-out editing a value no fold reads still checks all three hundred: 49 ms spent against
   * 520 ms of re-transform not done, and a 715 ms edit reduced to 183 ms.
   *
   * Giving up is always the safe direction — an unchecked dependent is treated as changed, which
   * is what this path did before any of this existed — so the bound can only cost the
   * optimisation, never correctness. It costs it where the optimisation was worth least: for the
   * run to reach eight, the consumers seen so far have to be uniformly changed.

   * Modules to re-transform because `file` changed, hard-invalidated on the way out.
   *
   * Invalidating is the fix. It drops the stale compiled result, which is the defect itself,
   * and it has to happen here rather than being left to `updateModules`: Vite *soft*-
   * invalidates an importer that statically imports the changed module, and a soft invalidation
   * keeps the cached transform — the very place the compiled class string lives.
   *
   * Doing it here also survives another plugin filtering the list afterwards — a framework's
   * own `hotUpdate` decides what its route modules do, and the stale bytes have to go either
   * way.
   *
   * *Naming* those modules back to Vite is a different question, and the answer is almost
   * always no. `addWatchFile` makes every consumer a direct importer of the dependency in the
   * module graph, so `propagateUpdate` walks to all of them from the changed file by itself and
   * sends exactly the same update. Returning them as well does not merge into that pass: a
   * framework plugin downstream reads the list and re-drives HMR per entry — react-router's
   * `react-router-server-change-trigger-client-hmr` calls `reloadModule` once per module, in
   * both its client and its ssr pass — and each of those is a separate `updateModules`, a
   * separate `hmr update`, and a separate refetch of the whole module by the browser.
   *
   * Measured on a five-route react-router app, one `css()` edit in a shared `ui.ts`: eight
   * `hmr update` messages, `root.tsx` and `dashboard.tsx` fetched five times each, 554 kB over
   * the socket for a one-line edit. Dropping the redundant half takes it to four messages and
   * 367 kB with the same modules re-transformed and the same edit applied.
   *
   * So the list is returned only when Vite has matched nothing for the file and would otherwise
   * do nothing at all — a dependency the fold read that never became a module of its own. That
   * one can end in a page reload, which is the honest outcome: its compiled classes really did
   * change, and a reload is what Vite does with any update nothing accepts.

       * with `reloadModule` in both its client and its ssr pass — a router revalidation.
       *
       * Skipping the *invalidation* follows from the same fact, and is where the cost actually
       * sits. Vite only soft-invalidates a module that statically imports the changed one, which
       * keeps its cached transform result and re-serves it for the price of rewriting import
       * timestamps; hard-invalidating turns that into a full re-transform through every plugin
       * in the chain. On a fan-out of twenty consumers of one shared module, editing a runtime
       * value no fold reads took the transforms Bamboo runs for that edit from 22 to 2.
       *
       * How much that is worth depends on whether the consumer's import statement *survives* the
       * fold. When it imports nothing from the module but the value being folded, the binding
       * goes dead, esbuild drops the statement, and the only edge left is the non-static one
       * `addWatchFile` created — which Vite hard-invalidates by itself, so declining to here
       * saves nothing and the re-fold is pure cost. Import one more thing from the same module,
       * which is the shape a real shared `ui.ts` has, and the statement stays, the consumer is a
       * static importer, and Bamboo's invalidation is the only reason it re-transforms at all.
       *
       * Safe by what "identical" means. The invalidation exists to drop a compiled class string
       * that no longer matches the source it was compiled from; when recompiling produces the
       * same string, there is nothing stale to drop. Whichever way the module is reached next —
       * Vite's own propagation, a later request, or nothing at all — the bytes it yields are the
       * bytes this fold just computed.
       *
       * Nor can it mask an update Vite would have sent by itself. This only ever withholds a
       * name Bamboo added; `modules` is passed through untouched. A consumer that also *imports*
       * the edited module for a runtime value is still reached by `propagateUpdate` exactly as
