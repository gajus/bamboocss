/**
 * The generated runtime's `css`, rebuilt in-process from a resolved context.
 *
 * A fold replaces a call with the string the runtime would have returned, so it has
 * to compute that string the same way the runtime does — not the way the stylesheet
 * does. The two differ in one respect that matters here: `StyleDecoder` escapes class
 * names for use in a CSS selector (`.c_red\.300`), while the runtime emits the raw
 * value that belongs in a `class` attribute (`c_red.300`). Folding the decoder's form
 * would put a stray backslash in the DOM.
 *
 * Matching the runtime this way makes the substitution behaviour-preserving by
 * construction. What still needs asserting — and is asserted in `__tests__` — is that
 * these class names correspond to rules the build actually emits.
 *
 * Mirrors `generateCssFn` in `@bamboocss/generator`: `css = memo((...styles) =>
 * cssFn(mergeCssUncached(...styles)))`, with the memo on the argument list and neither
 * inner cache. Unlike the generated runtime this one is built once per build and shared
 * across every module, so the outer cache is what carries the repeats.
 *
 * It departs from the runtime in one place: a key that is neither a property nor a condition
 * throws `UnknownConditionError` instead of being named. The runtime returns `_hovr:c_red.300`
 * for it, a class the stylesheet has no rule for.
